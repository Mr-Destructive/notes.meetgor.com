What a real developer is? Who knows languages? No, who knows how to code, No! A developer is someone who sticks to a problem when everyone has given up.&lt;br&gt;
This conversation feels like me and my friend. My friend is the reason I am here today. He knew programming well. I was inspired from him, he gave me advice to learn one programming language, I was boasting about python, C and C++. I feel like a kid here. That was 7 years ago, time flies by.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Distinguishing yourself early in your career as a developer</title><link>/posts/distinguish-yourself-as-a-developer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:42:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/distinguish-yourself-as-a-developer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is cool advice.
