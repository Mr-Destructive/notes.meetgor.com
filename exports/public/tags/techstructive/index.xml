&lt;p&gt;It was a harsh week. Not the roughest yet tiny exhilarating with new hopes. It happens, to get the best of me, things will come towards me with force. I am welcome to those challenges and hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in awe and inspired to build things, I went off track last week. The previous week I was pumped with two side project in a day, yet slumped then. This week would like to build that momentum back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #76</title><link>/posts/2026-01-09-techstructive-weekly-76/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2026-01-09-techstructive-weekly-76/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Week #76&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good start to the year, finally doing something that I had struggled to do for the past year or so. AI Assisted Programming. Yeah! That was something I finally somewhat understand, and can do it without feeling a slightest of grudge or emotional drama. It took a while to realize it, but here we are. 2026!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I feel right now. Its quite a good times to be in tech.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
