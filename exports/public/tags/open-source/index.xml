&lt;p&gt;This was my second year as a Hacktoberfest participant, First year was very dry and not so exciting as this turned out to be a cracker of an experience. With more than month gone in with only a few contributions, the second half of October was a splendid one for me where I made a lot more than in entire 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my Contributions so far in this month:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Filter and Find an Issue on GitHub</title><link>/posts/find-filter-github-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 17:42:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>/posts/find-filter-github-issues/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you stuck in finding an open-source project to contribute to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see how you can pick up an issue on GitHub appropriate as per your preferences of languages, labels, complexity, and thus you can find a Community or a project to work and continue with further contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process might not be as efficient but is quite helpful for beginners or people getting started to contributing to Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
