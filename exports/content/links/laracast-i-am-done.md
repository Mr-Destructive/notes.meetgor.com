- Laracast cut off 40% of the workforce, sad again AI in the hunt, after tailwind this is sad.
- They are producing more content but the way he thinks about code is changing.
- The important thing that hits me is **Agentic Coding doesn't drain mind**. Is this true? I don't think so. I feel like when I used to program, I thought about what to do, then plan it out, and actually writing the code would give me a buffer, a mental buffer to calm my mind from the actual cognition, it triggered a different part of my brain. But right now with agentic coding, the phase is too short, and it doens't trigger different parts of the brain, I have to review code which I am learning to, but it feels like I am getting too much load on the thinking part without actually taking a detox from it. It might be just me but this I need to change.
- Maybe this was the next iteration of programming, no one knows, but a good thing to see people admit.
