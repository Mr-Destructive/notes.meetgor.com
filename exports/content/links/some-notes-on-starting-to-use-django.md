I wonder if django is like unintentionally made for LLMs
It has everything suitable for context
- great docs
- 2 decades of stack overflow questions
- robust and explicit
- not exceptionally magical

It just makes sense, its like a mechanical part of a system, others might hide complexity or maybe too verbose
But django just hits the harness the right I think. I have read couple of articles on this and I think it makes sense.

Though for now I favor golang instead of django why? type system. You can add pydantic or mypy in django but out of the box support is where I am inclined towards for now.
