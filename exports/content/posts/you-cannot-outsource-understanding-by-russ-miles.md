So true.
We had assembly to programming language to no-code platforms, and now AI.
They all wanted to outsource the burden of managing or working with developers but eventually they end up in more of those.
Are software engineers really that bad, like people want to remove them?
Why? We solve problems (and end up creating more, but the original problem is indeed solved)
