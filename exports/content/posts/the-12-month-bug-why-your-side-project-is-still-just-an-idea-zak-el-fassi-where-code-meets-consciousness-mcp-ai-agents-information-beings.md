Maybe the fear is for short amount of time, what if we create it? But it turns out to be bad. I am not saying we are not incompetent, I am incompetent but it just breaks when you thought you could make it.

This might be very small percentage of it, but it happens to me every project. Not sure if that is just me, am I really incapable of making that project or is that my motivation lacks after the initial hump.

Need to stick to one project for a month and then compare to 4 projects in 4 weeks.
