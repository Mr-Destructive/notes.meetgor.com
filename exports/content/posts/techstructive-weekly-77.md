<h2>Week #77</h2><p>It was a harsh week. Not the roughest yet tiny exhilarating with new hopes. It happens, to get the best of me, things will come towards me with force. I am welcome to those challenges and hurdles.</p><p>I am in awe and inspired to build things, I went off track last week. The previous week I was pumped with two side project in a day, yet slumped then. This week would like to build that momentum back.</p><h3>Quote of the week</h3><blockquote><p>&#8220;You need to control the mind. Thoughts will tempt, but you decide to act or let it go&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>I must practise it heavily. Working remotely is tiring in a different way. Sometimes you just have no one to talk to, no one to understand your mindset. I get caught in overthinking and contemplating and procrastination. I need to divert myself to other things, its not like I don&#8217;t work. I just cannot resist AI to delegate the work and let me read more articles and watch tutorials and videos. It hard to control the mind, but I think its more important in being aware of it.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Read</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://antirez.com/news/158">Don&#8217;t Fall into the AI hype</a></p><ul><li><p>This is interesting and it comes at the right time</p></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway. What is the social solution, then? Innovation can&#8217;t be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy.</p></blockquote><ul><li><ul><li><p>All points and counterpoints are well addressed here. Innovation can&#8217;t be taken back, that just hits hard. Harsh reality even. AI is in the wild, you can&#8217;t avoid it, you&#8217;ll have to capture and understand them, just like pokemons. Its hard at first, but never say never. I learnt the hard way, kept giving AI things, tried different things, modes and models, and found the mindset shift. I found what I cared the most, but also a part of me felt taken away.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1085-A-Typical-PDF.html">A typical PDF document</a></p><ul><li><p>This is cool, I&#8217;ve read a lot of these and working at docsumo, makes me want to read about them more.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://davekiss.com/blog/ideas-are-cheap-execution-is-cheaper/">Ideas are cheap, Execution is cheaper</a></p><ul><li><p>Oh, my god.

I use it heavily. Yet I am looked as AI skeptic.</p></li><li><p>Frustrating to see their own analytics not getting into account. The acceptance is rubbish, you should not measure acceptance just measure the generation bit.
