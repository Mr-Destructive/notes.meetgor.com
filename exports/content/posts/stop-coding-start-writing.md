This hits hard!
> LLMs are a “calculator for words” and will only respond to what you put in.

Surely they indeed are the calculator for saphegetti code.

> You need to communicate. You went from working directly with code, to needing to communicate your assumptions, and it feels like an increased cost. The thing is, you’re probably not solo and you always should have been communicating when working with others. But writing a design doc was extra work, in the way of completing your immediate task when the code is already working. Now it’s not a side quest, it’s the main quest. You benefit directly from explaining yourself. Less time coding, more time communicating.

This point is true in some sense. I think we have abstracted, and not always is the abstraction fun, sometimes we love fiddling with the code and coming up with the solution ourselves rather than letting LLM rip it off
