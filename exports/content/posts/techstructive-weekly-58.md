<h2>Week #58</h2><p>What a week, almost broke prod for half an hour! On Monday, can you believe it? I didn&#8217;t but that was a bug. Patched it and moved on. Had a consistent posting and learning sessions daily for an hour about SQL and SQLite. Feels good. </p><p>Had an situation where knowing javascript was a big deal and I don&#8217;t feel like writing javascript, it just doesn&#8217;t appeal to me, I guess I have to amp that up. Anyways, one more reason added for hating javascript, its unavoidable.</p><blockquote><p>The only painful thing about Javascript, its unavoidable</p></blockquote><p>Yes, back to SQL, I am absolutely feeling energetic to talk and learn about SQLite daily. I think we&#8217;ll be 100 posts in no time. I am thinking about creating and completing a project this weekend. Let&#8217;s see if we are able to do it.</p><h3>Quote of the week</h3><blockquote><p>To live is to wrestle with despair, yet never allow despair to have the last word</p><p>&#8212; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19982-the-country-is-in-deep-trouble-we-ve-forgotten-that-a">Cornel West</a></p></blockquote><p>We all have problems, but we can&#8217;t let it define us, rather we will be defined on how we reacted to them. You can give up, but either you&#8217;ll be unsatisfied or below average. You have to go through the pain in order to bear the fruit, and even if the fruit doesn&#8217;t wag your way, so be it, if you enjoyed doing it (writing or reading in my case) then I believe that was worth it. Else what is the purpose of life? Who are we really and why do we even breathe. Just enjoy the thing you enjoy there is should be no measure for productivity when it comes to living.</p><h2>Wrote + Created</h2><ul><li><p>7 More posts in the SQLog Series or SQL Blog</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-cd-dot-command/">Change directory dot command</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-mode-dot-command/">Output Mode dot command</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-mode-dot-command-separators/">Output Mode Separator dot command</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-dot-command-header/">Header toggle dot command</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-create-table/">SQL: Create basic table </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-create-table-bare-bones-table/">SQL: Bare bones table in sqlite</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Updated my blog SQL codeblocks to support latest SQLite version 3.49 checkout <a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-scalar-function-3-valued-iif-and-if-scalar-function/">here</a></p></li><li><p>A demonstration video explaining about the blog I created <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/2695ff73fac940d1bd2d3b6432f1cb2a?sid=9fceb6f8-ec01-44c0-83f1-f41a7171adc0">link</a></p><p></p></li></ul><h2>Learnt</h2><ul><li><p>SQL week probably some 7, I am loosing count, let&#8217;s forget the week count from now</p><ul><li><p>SQLite has a rowid as a default primary key for distinguishing each row for a table.

What we can do is change our philosophy and the way we see things.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>This blog advocates to meditate 10 minutes a day, it helps maybe. I need to try. But that comes after doing something, you act first, then if the result is not coming, you get anxious and frustrated if it failed, in that case, you need to calm down, you did whatever you could, but now you need to wait for it to resolve or learn from the failures.</p></li><li><p>Getting anxiety from the current problems is true, I cannot keep my mind away. I need to breathe and let it go, will try over the weekend and continue if it makes me happier.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="http://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/sql-needed-structure/">SQL Needed structure</a></p><ul><li><p>This is a bad take, What is more structured than SQL? If you are trying to get heirarchial data in SQL, you will be comprising redundancy. Like literally for the ease of the access, you will duplicate json blobs everywhere. I work in that environment and know the pains of those queries. I won&#8217;t recommend MongoDB ever to anyone. Just use structured data, it would be a one time investment on schema design, but it sustains and is much easier and predictable.</p></li><li><p>It could have been other things like sharding, I would have agreed, but this nope.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/static-sites-enable-a-good-time-travel-experience/">Static Site enable a good time travel experience</a></p><ul><li><p>A really cool observation. Anyone can pick a commit hash and simply run a command to obtain the static files. Or better just checkout to the output branch and go back to the date. Its like a time machine.</p></li><li><p>I love static site generators.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/feel-it">You have to feel it</a></p><ul><li><p>Feel it, Just completing tasks, merging PRs, lists of metrics improved won&#8217;t help, if you don&#8217;t feel it.</p></li><li><p>Just creating for the completion is fine, sometimes needed, if you haven&#8217;t gone through the whole feeling, but not always, you need the drive to complete it in a sustainable way.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@himanshusingour7/how-i-learned-system-design-d7444d454367">How to learn System Design</a></p><ul><li><p>System design, something I can see myself struggling a lot if in a interview.
