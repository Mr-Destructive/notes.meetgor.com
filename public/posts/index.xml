&lt;li>what a flashback, everything makes sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Programming is not mechanical&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yet people tried hard to make solve for it as it was mechanical&lt;/li>
&lt;li>COBOL made syntax readable. CASE tools eliminated typing. Visual tools eliminated syntax. AI can now generate entire functions from descriptions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each advancement addressed a real friction point. Yet the fundamental challenge persists because it’s not mechanical. It’s intellectual. Software development is thinking made tangible&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Just sheer facts those two. We need to find a way around using AI not away from it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #77</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2026-01-16-techstructive-weekly-77/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2026-01-16-techstructive-weekly-77/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week #77&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a harsh week. Not the roughest yet tiny exhilarating with new hopes. It happens, to get the best of me, things will come towards me with force. I am welcome to those challenges and hurdles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am in awe and inspired to build things, I went off track last week. The previous week I was pumped with two side project in a day, yet slumped then. This week would like to build that momentum back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Typical PDF document</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/a-typical-pdf-document/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:19:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/a-typical-pdf-document/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is cool, i&amp;rsquo;ve read a lot of these and working at docsumo, makes me want to read about them more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't Fall into the ANTI AI HYPE</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/dont-fall-into-the-anti-ai-hype/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:34:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/dont-fall-into-the-anti-ai-hype/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is interesting and it comes at the right time&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is the social solution, then? Innovation can&amp;rsquo;t be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #76</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2026-01-09-techstructive-weekly-76/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2026-01-09-techstructive-weekly-76/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week #76&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a good start to the year, finally doing something that I had struggled to do for the past year or so. AI Assisted Programming. Yeah! That was something I finally somewhat understand, and can do it without feeling a slightest of grudge or emotional drama. It took a while to realize it, but here we are. 2026!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I feel right now. Its quite a good times to be in tech.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What happens when you start taking creativity seriously</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/what-happens-when-you-start-taking-creativity-seriously/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:42:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/what-happens-when-you-start-taking-creativity-seriously/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You have to defend your creativity&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That just triggered me up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sachin Tendulkar didn&amp;rsquo;t became a God of Cricket by accident, he defended his goal, he played to his strength and not defend his weakness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can avoid responsibilities, you can pursue your career without neglecting duties, it proved by people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why we have inflated expectations, 6 feet 7 inches</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/what-is-6-feet-7-inches/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:12:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/what-is-6-feet-7-inches/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is so true&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the 1990s, a “middle-class job” was enough to buy a house. Being “6 feet” was enough to be tall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 2020s, the middle has been hollowed out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be “wealthy” now requires a crypto-exit or a tech IPO (The Economic 6’7”).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be “famous” requires global virality (The Social 6’7”).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be “attractive” requires filters and surgery (The Aesthetic 6’7”).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>A conversation between a developer and a kid</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/dialuge-between-dev-and-kid/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:05:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/dialuge-between-dev-and-kid/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is hilariously funny.
What a real developer is? Who knows languages? No, who knows how to code, No! A developer is someone who sticks to a problem when everyone has given up.
This conversation feels like me and my friend. My friend is the reason I am here today. He knew programming well. I was inspired from him, he gave me advice to learn one programming language, I was boasting about python, C and C++. I feel like a kid here. That was 7 years ago, time flies by.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Printf Debugging in Go with Q</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/q-but-for-go-printf-debugging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:05:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/q-but-for-go-printf-debugging/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is cool, we make logging a mess.

Maybe its true. Django provided a good start but then it was like a lock in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With LLMs its quite easy to generate the boilerplatey code that django provides out of the box, so that demand is lost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its not the only reason django is here right? It has extensions, best python community and even more best documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it will be the best framework to build with LLMs in the future if the ecosystem continues to improve&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fear is not advocacy</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/ai-advocacy-should-not-be-fear-or-fomo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:46:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/ai-advocacy-should-not-be-fear-or-fomo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is real advice. People are hyping about the next workflow to 100x our productivity. Its ok to be 1x and still push less bugs than 100x and push 1000 bugs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Distinguishing yourself early in your career as a developer</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/distinguish-yourself-as-a-developer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:42:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/distinguish-yourself-as-a-developer/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is cool advice.

It just shows the passionate flowing out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The fear of not growing due to AI</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/fear-of-not-growing-due-to-ai/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:18:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/fear-of-not-growing-due-to-ai/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ah! This is a developer trying to love his craft, yet the people are cruel to not respect it. They just want to solve problems; no one cares, they are right, but empathy is traded for business value.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>you have everything you need</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/you-have-everything-and-nothing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:11:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/you-have-everything-and-nothing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man, that was a heck of an article to read. I continued reading it because I found it relatable to Minecraft.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You open a world, you have an empty inventory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Still you believe you can win the game&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without anything, &amp;ldquo;Kya lekar aya jagath me, kya lekar jayega&amp;rdquo; vibes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>True, read it, it will change your perspective on reasoning for failure in a good way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interstitial Journaling</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/interstitial-journaling/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:01:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/interstitial-journaling/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is cool, maybe a little too much time aware, maybe doing it too much is bad, but still, a good way to break the mental procrastination cycle
I think we can get a idea or get aware of the amount of time we wasted or done something good, and act on it accordingly. A nice trick for the brain&lt;/p>

I would keep it same this year, I might write a separate non-tech, a human yearly review on my separate blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gist">Gist&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I moved from a software developer to a reliable and responsible developer. I took ownership and sat on problems more than the level of my comfort zone. It made me a better developer, it helped me sympathize the people around me, and connect more. These moments might create life long relations, but from the macro perspective they looked frustrating and annoying at times. Here I am still finding peace and standing and walking through what has not been a smooth journey both at work and life. I was thinking work and life could mean same thing once I got out of college, but those kept diverging and I had to keep both my feet at par with each one&amp;rsquo;s pace.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advent of SQL 2025 Day 15: Confirmation Phrase Dispatches</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/advent-of-sql-2025-day-15/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 20:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/advent-of-sql-2025-day-15/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="advent-of-sql-day-15---confirmation-phrase-dispatches">Advent of SQL, Day 15 - Confirmation Phrase Dispatches&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>There were a few things, I had to dig up for converting the JSON &lt;code>ARRAY[]&lt;/code> in the statements into strings for SQLite, we can&amp;rsquo;t really use list of strings in SQLite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the command to convert that array of strings into string.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>sed &amp;#34;s/ARRAY\[&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;\[\&amp;#34;/g; s/&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;/\&amp;#34;,\&amp;#34;/g; s/&amp;#39;]/\&amp;#34;]&amp;#39;/g&amp;#34; day7-inserts.sql &amp;gt; day7-inserts-sqlite.sql
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>OK, once that&amp;rsquo;s done, this can be safely run into a sqlite database.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A pretty slow and sluggish week, but some momentum carried in the end. There was a disappointment after a glimmer of excitement when gemini 3 Flash dropped for the experiments that I was running for extraction of documents. It was maybe just the timing, but after this seeing code execution from chats, it was amazing. A good end to the work week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have continued to write Advent of SQL for the past 4 days, and brought back the streak of writing &lt;a href="https://meetgor.com/sqlog">SQLog&lt;/a>. I was not able to ship some code over the past weekend. But this weekend, I am pumped. I have time sorted out. Would be shipping some improvements in the website. Oh! I actually added snowball and particles based on season on &lt;a href="meetgor.com">my website&lt;/a> (only index and post pages).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advent of SQL 2025 Day 4: WinterFest Volunteers</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/advent-of-sql-2025-day-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/advent-of-sql-2025-day-4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="advent-of-sql-day-4-winterfest-volunteers">Advent of SQL Day 4 WinterFest Volunteers&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>A good productive week (I am not sure, I am saying that in the last month of 2025). I would be writing a yearly review in a couple of weeks and this week might lift my spirits up. I was fresh, given time off from work, not really, but given the time to experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read a lot, fiction, technical, even philosophical, and random Hacker News articles. I read 2 books of Harry Potter. I haven’t read Harry Potter, I have watched the first 3 movies, but not books. I enjoyed it, it was subtly different from movies, I missed the quote “What an Idiot” from the movies, it was not in the book, i was disappointed but the atmospheric adventures was amazing read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLITE SQL: Create Table with STRICT Option</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-create-strict-table/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-create-strict-table/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have seen how to create &lt;code>TABLE&lt;/code> loosely Not adhering to the types. Because if we create a table with column name of type text, and insert a integer, it will happily store it as text. It is very flexible as we saw. So, in such &lt;code>CREATE TABLE&lt;/code> statement in SQLite, without the &lt;code>STRICT&lt;/code> constraint, the types don&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you created a table with column type as XYZ it will accept it, because it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t see that. It will see the data coming in from the insert statement and store it whatever it thinks is the best one for that piece of data.

&lt;p>It was a roller-coaster week. Half of the week, it was travelling and outside. The rest was coping with AI news and code agents. Getting back to work after a week is a bit stressful and brings a bit of hurdle of health. I wasn’t quite well for a couple of days after the trip, and couldn’t really work at my 100% best. So, this weekend I would be pacing up, slowing down when needed to rest with ease. I have a few plans for Advent of Code, I haven’ gotten the time to solve even the first problem, looking forward to the weekend to keeping up with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly 70</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-29-techstructive-weekly-70/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-29-techstructive-weekly-70/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-70">Week #70&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I wrote last week, I would be travelling and out on a break due to weddings at my contry side place, cousins wedding, som heavy travelling no tech access for most of the time. However I had atleast 4 days of work covered so I have few tidbits to share. Weekends, three days of the week and taking leave on evening on wednesday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I played around with vllms , new different models for different thins ranging from ad hock coding tasks, proper code editing, and document extraction usecases. Didn’t find time to read or watch much.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly 69</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-22-techstructive-weekly-69/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-22-techstructive-weekly-69/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-69">Week #69&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was a good week. That’s what I can say. I continued writing. I experimented with quite a lot of things. VLLMs, new models, new approaches, tactics, and read a lot of articles as usual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I was in the GCP Cloud Log Explorer TUI in the bubbletea golang app, I vibe-coded it, I wanted to feel it. No, I am not using that to publish on GitHub. I would make one from bare hands, what to put in the model, on the screen, when to update what, which keybindings to add where, I will think about each of them and code from scratch. My goal is to learn and build, not just build.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly 68</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-15-techstructive-weekly-68/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-15-techstructive-weekly-68/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-68">Week #68&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was a great week. A consistent clean week. I wrote around 9k words on my project. I feel good again. I didn’t do much on the weekends as usual. I am slowing down. I did a lot of things at work, experiments, and more experiments on VLLMs and parsing documents. It’s fun times. I think for this weekend, I have plans as this post will cover what my mind is fixated on for the moment, Golang and TUIs, and a pain that is daily buzzing me, cleaning log files to get the actual data. LLMs are good at it, but take a bit of time for such trivial things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly 67</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-08-techstructive-weekly-67/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-11-08-techstructive-weekly-67/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-67">Week #67&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was a slow and steady week. New habits are emerging. It was a pleasant experience, I felt good, I kept myself out of the social media and content spiral doom-scrolling. Why? Because something changed the perspective of action and effect, the piece I was missing was intention.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="action-intention-and-effect">Action, Intention, and Effect&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I heard or read somewhere, that we feel anxious or we waste our time, not because of motivation, rather due to the lack of intentionality of the actions. If you are going to the web with a clear focus and a objective, no force or urge can stop you. Motivation helps but doesn’t carry you all the way. Its not one emotion or quality thing, rather all-hands together approach. You solely can’t rely on focus either, you need your inner fire, you need purpose, you need energy, you need the skills to do it.

&lt;p>It was a silent week, chipping away the days like wasted days. I didn’t do much, honestly, it was tiring and draining. I spent the weekend outside, had a few chores to complete, and didn’t quite get the time to sit at peace. This weekend too, looks the same. Post Diwali rituals, guests, and functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have long left the SQLog to decay, but I intend to pick it back up from tomorrow. Lot of things to do, little mental energy left.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly 65</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-10-25-techstructive-weekly-65/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-10-25-techstructive-weekly-65/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-65">Week #65&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A happy gloom Diwali, gone in a woosh. We are in a different year. 2082 Vikram Samvat, If you are into that. Felt a bit sad, a bit happy. Not sure what the next year might have in offer. Hopefully it would be for the good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to last tear, I find myself happier, but lost at the same time. I have found a cure to my writing slump atlast and trying to wrestle a writing routine. It looks a bit promising, 2 months to end 2025, still a comeback on the edge. This year was wild, I had severe anxiety and it kept throwing AI LLM Models every day, all day. Each day felt like waking up from existential crisis, but here I am writing it, the sixty fifth edition. More to come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #64</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-64/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-64/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-64">Week #64&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was a pretty busy week, not from a work perspective but from the chaotic household perspective. It is Diwali this weekend and next week. So, the preparations, the cleaning of homes, were done past weekend. It actually took my whole Sunday, sweet Sunday, and even half of Saturday. Hh! I read a lot of books, though. I found a great book that fits the vibe I wanted while being in the atmosphere of Diwali.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Test after resolving merge conflicts</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-10-17-test-after-resolving-merge-conflicts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-10-17-test-after-resolving-merge-conflicts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Its a beautiful sunny Monday, you had prepared changes well tested on Friday.

&lt;p>It was a fun week. After a long, a long I have had the time to rip-off a code base hands on and do something beyond pushing a feature, it was about reforming how a thing is approached. I felt really good. There are always rough days, but these days, the days that give you pain but that pain is satisfying. At the end of each day of the week, I had gone and came out of bed brimming full of ideas and questions to talk and sit through.

&lt;p>It was a great week. I didn’t knew I would say that at the start of the week. But hell yes, a promotion, finally. A hope at the end of the tunnel. Hard work pays off in the end. I kept believing and finally able to bring smile on my loved ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quoted last week about home, a family, is not something that is by blood, rather it is the group of people who strive for each others success, for uplifting each other, when one falls down the other roots for him or her, when its harsh time, everyone steps back and stays together.

&lt;p>Sometimes you want to create a new table based on data that already exists,maybe you’re archiving old rows, generating a summary, cloning a table, or transforming data into a new structure. Doing this might require you to write a &lt;code>CREATE TABLE&lt;/code> statement with all column definitions, then running one or more &lt;code>INSERT INTO&lt;/code> statements to populate it. That’s a lot of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, SQL is more flexible then you might think, Instead of manually defining columns and inserting data, you write one statement that both builds the table and fills it with the rows returned by your &lt;code>SELECT&lt;/code> query. This makes it incredibly useful for backups, and whatever you are doing (hopefully not taking down the prod db).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #61</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-61/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-61/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-61">Week #61&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A bit of slow and disappointing week on a personal note. I tried my best to be a backend developer but was not worthy of being one, I was stranded as a product developer. I am not saying I hate being a product developer, it just gets too menial and boring once you know the limitations and the quirks of a product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from the grill, I learnt a lot about tokenization. I also continued to write occasionally about SQLite in the SQLog, three more entries.

&lt;p>The &lt;code>CREATE TABLE&lt;/code> has one clause that we can add to create table if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist already. So this comes handy if you already have created a table and instead of throwing an error it simply gracefully handles the query and doesn&amp;rsquo;t re-create the table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s first creat a table, as usual, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the goodol &lt;code>users&lt;/code> table.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A Temporary table as the name suggests, is a temporary table. It only resisdes on the database until the current session of the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case of sqlite, the temporary table is available in the session until the file reader or session driver closes the connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The table is created in a separate database file called &lt;code>temp&lt;/code> that is stored in your temporary path.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="create-a-temporary-table">Create a temporary table&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To create the temporary table, simply use the &lt;code>TEMP&lt;/code> or &lt;code>TEMPORARY&lt;/code> keyword before the &lt;code>TABLE&lt;/code> in &lt;code>CREATE TABLE&lt;/code> expression.

&lt;p>Another great week, consistently learning SQL, developing another streak for solving problems on FreeCodeCamp with Javascript and Python, reading instead of doomscrolling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been learning about SQL since maybe 10 weeks now and finding myself in a good position, for the past 4 weeks I have written posts every day and it has helped me get back to the technical writing flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the work side, it was a fun week, tinkering with a system that is already working decently and wanted it to get the most of it, turning the bits and knobs of a system is so cool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: One to One Relations</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-one-to-one-relations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-one-to-one-relations/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="one-to-one-relations">One to One Relations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I might missed this basic relationship model as I haven&amp;rsquo;t really found it quite commonly used, but its still used in very specific examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That one relationship is &lt;code>one-to-one&lt;/code>. As the name suggests, it maps one row to exactly one row.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike the &lt;code>one-to-many&lt;/code> relation which had one of the records/rows from the tables or entities connected by multiple ropes, both the records/rows from the tables or entities are connected by only one rope in &lt;code>one-to-one&lt;/code> relation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: Many to Many Relations</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-many-to-many-relations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-many-to-many-relations/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="many-to-many-relations">Many to Many Relations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have seen &lt;a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-one-to-many-foreign-key/">one-to-many&lt;/a> relationship and also the &lt;a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-self-join-relations">self-join&lt;/a> relationship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s extend it with &lt;code>many-to-many&lt;/code> relationship. Here one row can refer to many other rows, but that other row can also be referred by multiple rows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was confusing, let&amp;rsquo;s take the simple example of &lt;code>users&lt;/code> and &lt;code>posts&lt;/code> as usual.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In &lt;code>One-To-Many&lt;/code> relation, one post can only be written by one user. However, one user can author multiple posts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In &lt;code>Many-To-Many&lt;/code> relation, one user can author multiple posts and one post can be written by multiple users.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s create a single table where we can define a &lt;code>one-to-many&lt;/code> relationship. Yes, within a single table we can reference the primary key and it can act like a link. Since it isn&amp;rsquo;t really about the table, it&amp;rsquo;s more about the row relation form each other, we an connect any rows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: One to Many Relation with Foreign Key</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-one-to-many-foreign-key/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-one-to-many-foreign-key/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="one-to-many-relation-with-foreign-key">One to Many Relation with Foreign Key&lt;/h2>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Foreign key as the name suggest, this is a key referencing or pointing to a foreign (other) table, and that key could be a primary key for that table, hence referred to as key.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since, &lt;code>PRIMARY KEY&lt;/code> is a table level constraint, it only can be defined once for the table, as it needs to be unique for each record inserted in that table.

&lt;p>The PRIMARY KEY constraint is not actually a column constraint, it is a table constraint. But in this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll only learn about how to handle single column-level &lt;code>PRIMARY KEY&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#the_primary_key">PRIMARY KEY&lt;/a> column constraint is a constraint that ensures that a column contains unique values and is the &lt;code>PRIMARY&lt;/code> way to distinguish between all the rows of that table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the documentation:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Each table in SQLite may have at most one PRIMARY KEY. If the keywords PRIMARY KEY are added to a column definition, then the primary key for the table consists of that single column. Or, if a PRIMARY KEY clause is specified as a table-constraint, then the primary key of the table consists of the list of columns specified as part of the PRIMARY KEY clause. The PRIMARY KEY clause must contain only column names — the use of expressions in an indexed-column of a PRIMARY KEY is not supported. An error is raised if more than one PRIMARY KEY clause appears in a CREATE TABLE statement. The PRIMARY KEY is optional for ordinary tables but is required for WITHOUT ROWID tables.
If a table has a single column primary key and the declared type of that column is &amp;ldquo;INTEGER&amp;rdquo; and the table is not a WITHOUT ROWID table, then the column is known as an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY. See below for a description of the special properties and behaviors associated with an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.
Each row in a table with a primary key must have a unique combination of values in its primary key columns. For the purposes of determining the uniqueness of primary key values, NULL values are considered distinct from all other values, including other NULLs. If an INSERT or UPDATE statement attempts to modify the table content so that two or more rows have identical primary key values, that is a constraint violation.
According to the SQL standard, PRIMARY KEY should always imply NOT NULL. Unfortunately, due to a bug in some early versions, this is not the case in SQLite. Unless the column is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY or the table is a WITHOUT ROWID table or a STRICT table or the column is declared NOT NULL, SQLite allows NULL values in a PRIMARY KEY column. SQLite could be fixed to conform to the standard, but doing so might break legacy applications. Hence, it has been decided to merely document the fact that SQLite allows NULLs in most PRIMARY KEY columns.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #59</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-59/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-59/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-59">Week #59&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#check_constraints">CHECK&lt;/a> clause is a column constraint that allows us to define certain conditions that we want to evaluate before inserting the column for the row and populate it accordingly. In this post, we will check, what this check is and when it is performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-it-checks">What it checks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>CHECK&lt;/code> constraint basically acts a validator, we define the condition and if the condition is not met (is false) then the row is not inserted or updated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: GENERATED column constraint</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-generated-column-constraint/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-generated-column-constraint/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-generated-column-constraint">The GENERATED column constraint&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We saw certain limitations of the &lt;code>DEFAULT&lt;/code> column constraint clause, that it can&amp;rsquo;t generate dynamic values based on other columns or some other dynamic popularities. For overcomming those kind of constraints, there is one more specific constraint, the &lt;a href="https://sqlite.org/gencol.html">GENERATED&lt;/a> column constraint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can think of it as a &lt;code>DEFAULT&lt;/code> but having more than static values, it is evaluated and computed each time a new row is inserted. However they come with one catch, you can&amp;rsquo;t later update the values, you need to update the values of the dependent columns first, so it will generate &lt;strong>ALWAYS&lt;/strong> a update is made to the row(relevant columns in that row).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: DEFAULT column constraint</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-default-column-constraint/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-default-column-constraint/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="default-constraint">DEFAULT Constraint&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>DEFAULT&lt;/code> constraint in SQLite is used to specify a default value for a column, if not provided, then the column will be populated with the &lt;code>NULL&lt;/code> value as the default value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the docs:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The DEFAULT clause specifies a default value to use for the column if no value is explicitly provided by the user when doing an INSERT. If there is no explicit DEFAULT clause attached to a column definition, then the default value of the column is NULL.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: UNIQUE column constraint</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-unique-column-constraint/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-unique-column-constraint/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="unique-constraint">Unique Constraint&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> constraint ensures that a column in a table contains no duplicate values. Like, if you add an &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> constraint to a column, then no two rows can have the exact/same value for that column.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The documentation is more nuanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> constraint is similar to a &lt;code>PRIMARY KEY&lt;/code> constraint, &lt;strong>except&lt;/strong> that a single table may have any number of &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> constraints. For each &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> constraint on the table, each row must contain a unique combination of values in the columns identified by the &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> constraint. For the purposes of &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> constraints, &lt;code>NULL&lt;/code> values are considered distinct from all other values, including other NULLs. As with &lt;code>PRIMARY KEY&lt;/code>s, a &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> table-constraint clause must contain only column names — the use of expressions in an indexed-column of a &lt;code>UNIQUE&lt;/code> table-constraint is not supported.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: NOT NULL column constraint</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-not-null-column-constraint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-not-null-column-constraint/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="not-null-column-constraint">NOT NULL Column constraint&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>NOT NULL&lt;/code> constraint is a column-level constraint that will prevent the insertion/updation of a &lt;code>NULL&lt;/code> value in that column record.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is &lt;code>NULL&lt;/code>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In SQLite, specifically, a &lt;code>NULL&lt;/code> is a value indicating that a value is not known or just not there.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>NOTE: NULL is not equal to &lt;code>''&lt;/code> empty string, &lt;code>0&lt;/code> or &lt;code>0.0&lt;/code> (zero), it&amp;rsquo;s just cannot be compared to any value.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have seen the table creation with column types, we now need to look into the constraints or limitations that we can add to those columns, in order to make the data-model more robust and add some basic validations before doing any updation/mutation on the data itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To add a constraint, we can specify it at the end of the column name, after the type, so there are a list of constraints that could be added to column, which are relevant to specific scenarios of the actual model of the column.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite SQL: Create Table with column types</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-create-table-column-types/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/sqlite-create-table-column-types/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="creating-a-table-with-column-types">Creating a table with column types&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you want to store values in a column with a specific type, you need to specify one of the following types in order to store that value in relatively type specific data.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>TEXT&lt;/code> (string or characters, bunch of text)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>BLOB&lt;/code> (binary data, images, raw files, etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>INTEGER&lt;/code> (numbers which are whole, like 1, 67, 986, etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>REAL&lt;/code> (floating or decimal point numbers, like 3.14, 85.98, 999.99, etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>NULL&lt;/code> (empty or not defined)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Type affinity is what determines how a data is being stored and treated in sqlite, so we&amp;rsquo;ll need to cover that separately. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the data you give in is indeed valdiated before sending over to the database (that rarely is the case though) but for now we can avoid that discussion, and focus on creation of the structure and relations of the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #58</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-58/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-58/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-58">Week #58&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="iif-before-348">IIF Before 3.48&lt;/h2>

&lt;h3 id="simple-if-then-else">Simple IF THEN ELSE&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We can use the IIF function by passing 3 paraeters, first is the condition to check, the second is the value to return if the condition is true and the third is the value to return if the condition is false.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SQLite functions: unistr and unistr_quote</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/unistr-and-quote-unicodes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/unistr-and-quote-unicodes/</guid><description>&lt;p>SQLite &lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_50_0.html">3.50&lt;/a> introduced &lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#unistr">unistr&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#unistr_quote">unistr_quote&lt;/a> functions&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;code>unistr&lt;/code> is used to take in the escape sequences and return the actual unicode string

&lt;li>You need to scale on day 1 (your app is small but not your ambitions)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reliability and Rollback&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The post rightly mentioned the points that come in the way of deployment:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Complexity and Learning curve&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Managing the platform instead of building the product&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I think these two are good enough reasons to not use Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also agee with these 2 points strongly. I have seen and experienced it myself at my current company.

Still in the end I was the one biting teeth and on the burn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #51</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-51/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-51/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-51">Week #51&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another hectic week, the work seems unstoppable and almost killing my back. Had to work almost 12 hours at stretch to get something in production. Not the best of times to be working at. Especially when life puts you in wired position, not just in work but in mental situation, you have to believe in yourself and amidst that every other bit of things happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="random-thought">Random Thought&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was working away some bugs and fixing issues which was created for some other purpose at the time of initial prototype. But as the time evolved, it changed and deviated from the initial purpose, so fixed the current problem at hand. But people then point out your decisions. I felt grieved, lost, and most importantly wrong. But then things clarify, working all the possibilities of blunder out. Only problem was the decision made by the person in front of me when I asked the question in the past. But it was my fault in the end today. Not blaming anyone, just letting my thoughts out that people are too quick to judge and blame you when things go wrong rather than clarifying what they discussed first. World is cruel for the symphatic, for the humble, for the kind. It’s just is life. Can’t do much. But will you with one inspiration if you are lashed out at and the tides are against you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #50</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-50/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-50/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-50">Week #50&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A bit of boring week, had a lot of hopes starting on Monday, but it just tumbled down. Also broke the 15 day long writing streak. It all just falls apart, I want to change things now. I work remotely, and not able to balance work-life and personal life, its just too exhausting. I get self-doubt creep up with this, am I really a sustainable developer, can I not continue development for the next 10 years even? It is starting to haunt me. I know it would be temporary, imposter syndrome feeling, but need to really change the flow of my daily routine to get a mindset shift.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #49</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-49/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-49/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-49">Week #49&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ll keep this week short, I have a lot to learn, and too little time. I have been studying SQL in detail, practising problem sets over the week. Taking a few more courses on Redis, Python, and more SQL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One interesting thing, I kept on with my creative writing endeavour and made 14 days streak, writing with an average of 1200 words a day. So, I am roughly at 20k words after 15 days on my novel. This could be my first novel, could be even ready by the end of July if I keep going after it. Sounds exciting to me. Can’t wait to complete it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #48</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-48/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-48/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-48">Week #48&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An fruitful week, not much on tech created, but a lot of learning and revising about the first principal thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to create a Pocket clone in Typescript with some AI-assisted (a bit of vibe coding) because I don’t like writing frontend. I failed a few times, and even my network seems to be off for a while, so I had to scrape that idea and stop streaming for the weekend. So, it didn’t quite work out. Instead this weekend I’ll only stream on Saturday to start one project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #47</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-47/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-47/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-47">Week #47&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was a exciting and exhaustive week, in a good way. I was able to almost complete a working AI Chatbot Application, start writing routine for an hour, get inspiration for more project ideas, and a lot of learning in tid-bits around LLMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can’t be more exciting. A week or two before I was drenched in anxiety and negativity around LLMs as replacement for developers, but that’s far from reality and considering them as tools sounds so fun. I feel excited so much so that I feel I have no time to squeeze the energy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #46</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-46/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-46/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-46">Week #46&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Life takes turns pretty quickly. I was here last week, complaining about life and here I am today, feeling grateful for whatever happened to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took decisions last week and by mid-week, I was seeing results, like actual results. And I was just thrilled to experience it, when you decide to change, the universe listens and blesses you with opportunities. I am grateful for the things blessed to me through the week. Even if I fail next week, I have a head start to keep going and break the shackles one day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #45</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-45/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-45/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-45">Week #45&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week was exciting at first, but slowly it went on the extreme bad spectrum for me, leaving a spot for taking a bold decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost on the verge of a burnout or a big decision. Its been 3 months now, the first sparkle was created and now I think its high time to take the big decision. It’s no longer rash, but it’s a long thought decision.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Python version in a UV project</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/getting-python-version-in-a-uv-project/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/getting-python-version-in-a-uv-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was live streaming, creating a AI Coding Agent from scratch in Python.

&lt;p>Anyways, the thing is the uv python project has a &lt;code>. python_version&lt;/code> file that will store the python version.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was week of comeback. 1 videos and 2 live streams, back on track. Though lost the steam in the middle of the week. Still fresh and excited to get hands on projects this weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Appwrite Sites? Android Apps for LLMs? AI Agents with some specific goals?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll roll the die and let’s nature take where it wants to. We’ll start though, I realized it at the end of last week. No brainer right, once I start something, it quickly makes me addicted to completing it and the thing in between is curiosity and consistency. Not hamering buzzwords, but truly, I just started to record the video for pydantic AI and I created a few examples, within an hour I had 7 examples created. Some of which I had to discard, but nonetheless, enough material for a video to record.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A draft post</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/a-draft-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/a-draft-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello, this is a draft post&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #43</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-43/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-43/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-43">Week #43&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What a whirlwind of a week. This was expected, nothing new. New week, new models, every day feels closer to losing the developer job. But everytime, AI sucks and human grug brain works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I took a step back and tried to ease myself out from this AI slop. Want to really plan the things out and start the grind again. Need to re-align my core values and get back to the consistent and curious flaming torch in guiding myself in the AI abyss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I kind of hate Agentic IDEs for the sake of productivity</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/i-kind-of-hate-agentic-ides-for-the-sake-of-productivity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/i-kind-of-hate-agentic-ides-for-the-sake-of-productivity/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is May 2025, we are halfway through 2025. And tech world has gone a 180-degree turn in how developers are working. With the rise of Agentic IDEs (yes, that is a deliberate buzzword, I am using) like Windsurf, Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, Claude code, Warp, Amp code, whatever agent in the loop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not saying any of those are good or bad, they have their own quirks and preferences. Just like I love Vim and you hate it, or loving VS Co**. Maybe that war would happen to some extent, but developers, we are in crisis. No time to have text-editor wars.

&lt;p>Appwrite started out as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and in many ways, it still is. It offered things like databases, authentication, file storage, and cloud functions, basically the complexity of backend for an application. One of its biggest strengths? It’s fully open source and self-hostable!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was Appwrite ages ago, but today, they are not just Backend as a service, they now have &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-appwrite-sites">sites&lt;/a>, you can deploy single page applications to Appwrite. And that is the MOAT of Appwrite, Appwrite quietly emerged as a powerful contender behind the likes of Vercel and in just a few years, it’s become a compelling all-in-one stack.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #42</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-42/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-42/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-42">Week #42&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It has been a nasty week, both physically and emotionally. I am sick right now, still somehow finding the right amount of energy to pump this edition out. I have a sore throat and fever. Twitchy eyes in the cold make things worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But emotionally, I have been on the battlefield, it seems. The battle has started between my heart and mind. The one that cares about the craft, my soul, and the other about the ego, duties and responsibilities, fame, the thing that I am right now. It’s intense, I am barely able to breathe and think. It’s making me doubt myself, my decisions, my efforts, and my existence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #41</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-41/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-41/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-41">Week #41&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A slow-moving week overall. I had some spiritual realizations, not major, but enough to clear mental clutter and ease the overthinking through action, without worrying about results&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The past weekend was too boring; I was not able to do anything fancy. Didn’t live stream, nor create a video. I think videos are not my thing for the moment, It takes too much energy to edit and polish my voice, and I don’t see enough return on that investment right now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #40</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-40/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-40/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-40">Week #40&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What a week, I knew the silence was just temporary, it would come at once, thankfully it was not too much releases to keep track of. There was, however, one release of a model (or a family of models) from Alibaba Cloud with the Qwen suite of models, that overthrew the Meta AI LLama Models from the SOTA standard for open source models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I explored a bit about LLMs and how to operate with them effectively, thanks to the prompt engineering masterclass from Anthropic. I created a bunch of things, leaving aside my fear and procrastination. This week, I was a bit self-critical of myself but was able to break through the chains and took some hard decisions and executed, the results? Not sure, maybe good, might not work. But that is not in my hands; whatever was, is done. Time to move ahead and explore this AI revolution firsthand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #39</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-39/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-39/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-39">Week #39&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A pretty active week, learning more about LLMs without getting distracted by a new model release (somehow this week there were no major releases by any provider, we can breathe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I truly explored the capabilities of LLMs, and to be honest, I was shocked. Moments before we thinking of a solution and pasted the problem in the LLM chat, with thinking and it was able to point out the exact solution. It was a subtle thing, but it makes humans wonder what their purpose is in life. I am kidding, of course, there are lot of things to improve upon as a human and a developer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #38</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-38/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-38/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-38">Week #38&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A week after ages, I finally had some energy, some spark back. I am actually overwhelmed with this AI revolution, too many ideas, too little mental space, its just moving too fast. Like I feel, I was just in this newsletter yesterday, and here I am a week gone with so many things launched, dropped, and bomb shelled.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="speed-in-the-ai-revolution">Speed in the AI Revolution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Yes, AI launches feel like a bomb shell being dropped, in a good way, but can someone tell these AI companies to take a breath? At this pace, we all will be juggling models all the time. New models every week, deprecation of previous models, new ways to interact with tools, it’s just creating an endless cycle of progress. Yes, we might be progressing in better human intelligence,e but at the cost of letting too many possibilities just dying out due to speed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #37</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-36/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-36/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-37">Week #37&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A bit of a hectic week. For the past quarter, the weeks have been quite rough, and this is continuing this month too. Need to really breathe air, and take my mind off for a while. But something hurts to quit and take a rest. Bad habits are really hard to break, like not creating a video is becoming my bad habit, really deciding to take action and actual action is the biggest difference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Add hunks: only line specific changes with git add -p</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/add-hunks-only-line-specific-changes-with-git-add-p/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/add-hunks-only-line-specific-changes-with-git-add-p/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had made the changes for a future release, next set of changes so to speak in git terms.

&lt;p>Was quite a work-holic week, did a lot of things this week. Debugging, prompting, scripting, flying through a random codebase and number crunching. I felt good, I am genuinely curious about Agents now and want to experiment a lot this weekend. Will have a video or two about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally it was a week, a little slow down after a 2 back to back weeks of AI launching and breaking the expectations. The image generation, gemma models, gemini 2.5 and mistral OCR, and what not have been released in the last stretch of first quarter of 2025. Phew! it was a heck of a quarter, that went in a jiffy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #35</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-35/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-35/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-35">Week #35&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It has been quite a busy week, with some ups and downs at work. Another Friday release, a lot of patching and end-moment clutches to get it on time. I am not bragging, it is not good, but it is unavoidable at times, I am so proud that I was able to deliver it, despite having a weird situation in life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Life is tough, there was a rough day this week in my life, things just get worse and worse, and then get a little hope. That hope might be too tiny, not enough to heal the mind, but enough to carry life. It is tough, I need to stand and stay strong and find a way out because I am destined to be great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robots Generate, Humans Manifest</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/robots-generate-humans-manifest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/robots-generate-humans-manifest/</guid><description>&lt;p>To,
New Graduates or Students (or whoever is scared of AI)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’ve probably noticed the AI buzz lately, the chatbots, image generators, and tools that seem to do everything. If you haven’t, good for you! It means you’re not glued to your phone, and that’s a win. But for those who’ve felt the hype or the creep, it’s hard to ignore. People are shouting about an AI revolution, some with awe, others with warnings. It’s changing things fast, and I want to share what I see as a junior software developer living in this wild moment. However, if you had heard about it, surely you would have felt the creep.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Friction is necessary in our lives, more the solutions, more the problems.</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/friction-is-necessary-in-our-lives-more-the-solutions-more-the-problems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/friction-is-necessary-in-our-lives-more-the-solutions-more-the-problems/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #33</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-03-15-techstructive-weekly-33/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-03-15-techstructive-weekly-33/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-33">Week #33&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally a bit of stress reliving week. After constant hustle at work, this week felt a little less stressful (not stress as that stress, just too much cognitive load to handle). However I made 2 releases happen, a few experiments and brainstorming for cracking a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="work">Work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This week made me realise, I sometimes do things. I was asked to figure out a metric that we need to provide to a customer based on their customers data, they basically need to understand the data of the customer, however the data is too much and they forward to us to extract and analyse on top of that. So, my job was to figure out the requirement of them, they need to understand the pattern in the data of the customer and that is not quite easy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #34</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-34/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-34/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="week-34">Week #34&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It was a pretty busy and productive week. After three hectic weeks of research, hacking, scripting, implementing, Google Sheets, and Python Vulture coding an API, I made a few releases. Yes, that is the normal role of a software engineer at a startup. I get to wear multiple hats: analysing, writing, debugging, scripting, testing, and obviously communicating effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was able to complete the implementation successfully. The release somehow happened on a Friday evening, which I am skeptical about, but it happened without any hiccups, a few minor ones. It will all be well if it ends well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zellij Open Scrollback Edit mode</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/zellij-open-scrollback-edit-mode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/zellij-open-scrollback-edit-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was looking at a long list of logs, (debugging of course).&lt;/p>

I used to get confused with parsing and rendering the template, this makes it really clear by showing bit-sized examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Using custom functions is a high-value tip, I can see myself using those for string-related functions like title case, stringify, date parsing, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another great example is the templates, we can create partials for reusability.&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Understand that time is on your side if you take action. You have about a year, maybe less. Whatever you do - do not squander it. Your edge right now is a large majority of software engineers have not discovered what you have.

&lt;p>Weeks of chaos have left me on the brink of burnout, with no time to breathe or reflect. Didn’t get much time to just sit and think, just had to complete a few hacks here and there to get the demo running, poor management and blind eyeing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What a week, again, a bit of thump and bumps, a bit of scare at work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week was hectic, this week was continuing that bump in increased responsibilities. I think I might be transitioning from Junior to Senior, but the mindset might be of a junior, need to step up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What a week captain! Realized this on Wednesday truly. A bit of exhausting yet exciting week, it was a wild ride, true but learnt a lot. A lot of mistakes popping up at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to scamper and get things done, not just do it, but do it correct, not only do it correct , but also do it more, that was exaggerated, but yes, it was a bit taxing at some point, but the reward? I don’t care, I did my best (to some extent) and I am leaving the result to nature, really can’t control that now. A lot of intense debugging sessions, pair programming, side scripting, a lot of fun conversations and moments, it was worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #29</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-02-15-techstructive-weekly-29/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-02-15-techstructive-weekly-29/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-29">Week #29&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was a fun week. There was a bit of laziness, for sure, but also some work done. I didn’t create a video this week and took a bit of a break. I think it is as important to upskill as it is to maintain streaks of uploading.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This week was a bit frustrating, but I really want to continue what I am working on. However, life is pushing me in a different direction, and I am so confused. I have responsibilities to perform and situations to tackle. It is a bit hard to live ahead, but I will stay with my three pillars: curiosity, consistency, and grit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I created one video, and that’s it. It was just a bit of a hectic weekend, so I didn’t have much free time. However, on weekdays, I was able to learn about subdomains, LLMs, and more. I read a lot about writing, and at this point, I am overwhelmed with writing advice. I think it is high time to write consistently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #27</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-02-01-techstructive-weekly-27/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-02-01-techstructive-weekly-27/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-27">Week #27&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was a bit of lazy day, not that lazy though, did a lot of things while being lazy. I had been doing a lot of things in the past few weeks, so this week I decided to take things a little slowly. If I just keep on being that productive, it would be a burnout soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I created a new kind of video using a presentation-style approach, wrote a bit of python, and debugged it a ton, and now I see why tests are handy. I don’t have to debug the issue every time I make a change here, If run tests, I know exactly which test failed and where to look out for so easily.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #26</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-25-techstructive-weekly-26/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-25-techstructive-weekly-26/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-26">Week #26&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week was really fun and exciting, I am continuing with more productive weeks. I was able to fix a lot of things this week. I created three videos this week. Worked on the side project with 2 live streams. Was able to demonstrate to the team at my work about the AI Agents. It was a great week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next week I am planning to wrap up the series of CRUD Applications with Golang, Netlify cloud functions, and LibSQL by adding authentication and authorization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #25</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-18-techstructive-weekly-25/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-18-techstructive-weekly-25/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-25">Week #25&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was an exciting week, I did complete a lot of things on my work side, I had a bit of change in the routine of my work, an hour early, which makes me really productive and gets a lot of things done quite early and more importantly, I am now able to dedicate myself more time to learning new things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I didn’t release any videos, I was a bit exhausted and wanted to slow down a little, but I was not sitting idle, I was evaluating a project idea for some future videos, and the project is ready. Next week, expect some high-quality and in-depth videos.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang Web: DELETE Method</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-web-delete-method/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-web-delete-method/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have explored GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH methods in our previous entries for this series. It is the final entry for all the HTTP methods which is going to be the &lt;code>DELETE&lt;/code> method. In this entry of the series, we will take a view on how to construct and request an HTTP DELETE Method to an API Endpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DELETE Method is quite simple. You just provide the URI of the resource. Most often, the request body is not needed. That request will simply delete the request entity from the server (in the database or wherever the resource is stored).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang Web: PATCH Method</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-web-patch-method/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-web-patch-method/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In previous sections of this series, we&amp;rsquo;ve covered the GET, POST, and PUT methods. Now, we will explore the PATCH method, which differs from the others in several key ways. The PATCH method is somewhat more flexible and depends on how the server or API you&amp;rsquo;re working with is designed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on understanding what the PATCH method is and how to use it. While we will dive deeper into building and structuring a full CRUD API later in the series, the focus here will be on the what and why of the PATCH method, not the how.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #24</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-11-techstructive-weekly-24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-11-techstructive-weekly-24/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-24">Week #24&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was an exciting week. I was pretty excited from the end of the past week with a new beginning to my work-life goal. After completing one, I have a new challenge in front of me: diving into the world of cutting-edge LLMs, agents, and Workflow. This can’t be more exciting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I was researching and exploring the frameworks, libraries and tools to create Agentic Workflows with LLMs, I can’t share much, but I see myself creating content around the things I will learn at my work/day job.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #23</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-04-techstructive-weekly-23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2025-01-04-techstructive-weekly-23/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are in 2025!

&lt;p>There were a lot of debugging sessions. I wanted to solve the advent of code but struggled for 10 days. Yes, and I have been struggling for 15 days at the blog event. I am still hoping to clear a few problems over the weekend. I am also looking to write some articles over the weekend.

&lt;p>This week was a slow-moving week, it was a time when we see winters in Mumbai, just for a couple of days and that made me too lazy to wake up early which in turn ruined the entire day. It was that type of week, but good progress.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is day 5 of the advent of code, and today we have an interesting problem of ordering pages. Let’s dive into the problem and how I approached it. It was a pretty simple problem if thought it peacefully, otherwise, it would get into a map, list, and indices mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="input">Input&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the input for day 5, we have two sections, The first defines the rules for ordering the pages, specifically which page should come before which and the second contains the actual order of pages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advent of Code Day 4 in Golang: Finding XMAS and X-MAS</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Moving on to day 4, we have a grid problem in front of us, we are given some numbers in the form of a grid, i.e. some rows and columns with some upper case letters. What we need to do is to find is the word &lt;code>XMAS&lt;/code> in any direction (up, left, down, right, diagonals), and in the second part we need to find the word &lt;code>MAS&lt;/code> forming an X.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advent of Code Day 3 in Golang: Do Or Don’t Regex</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>It was a pretty good week, with 2 videos published, 1 short created, and 4 live streams done, and 3 days of AOC solved. Phew!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Saturday last week, I experimented with Netlify cloud functions in Golang and also for Turso’s LibSQL Database, and that went pretty well. Then started a livestream for the SSG in Golang, and completed the feed loading. Then on Sunday it was AOC Day 1, where I live-streamed it, created the video, and also scheduled the Netlify cloud functions video for Monday.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advent of Code Day 2 in Golang: Slicing and Dicing Reports</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, this is day 2 of the Advent of Code 2024 in Golang, and we will be exploring my approach and solution for the same. The problem was not as easy but was pretty simple after implemented and found correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can check out my solutions &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/advent_of_code/blob/main/2024/src/day02/main.go">here on GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have been given some lines called reports, and each report has a bunch of levels. and the requirement of the report is that it needs to be either strictly increasing or decreasing by a factor of at least 1 or at most 3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advent of Code, 2024, Day 1 in Golang: Historian Hysteria</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/aoc-2024-day-1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hello everyone, it’s that time of the year, Advent of Code, I will be solving this year as well with Golang. In previous years I have been doing Advent of Code but was not able to keep up with the pace and left it midway (not even halfway). This year however I am determined and want to solve all the problems as much as I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s dive into the first day which should be and is pretty simple and straightforward. A simple list and map creation and traversal and basic math operations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sample TIL</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/first_til/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/first_til/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>It was a great week, if I could call it a hard-working week, it would be appropriate. I started the week (the weekends) by streaming, creating a video, and planning a few more videos for the next week. Then starting the week with deep intense programming sessions, a couple of flow states during the week made the mind feel accomplished and excited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After releasing the code that I had been working on for so long in the past week, this week was about taking a new approach to the initial implementation, and it was smooth, it felt good, I was able to change the code that I had written faster and iterate on it quickly. This gave me the confidence that I can write production-ready and readable code. I am not that bad, there is a lot to improve on but quite a good feeling to live with and continue the work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gotcha with Chained Assignment in Python</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/python-chain-assignment-gotcha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/python-chain-assignment-gotcha/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was writing some Python code and wanted to initialize a few variables to an empty list. Instead of creating separate lists for each variable, I decided to use chained assignments like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> b &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> c &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">3&lt;/span>]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It seems okay, nothing new, we are just assigning a, b, and c as an empty list. But notice the problem if you can.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What a week, had written code through all the days, thought a lot about solving certain issues, integrated reviewed changes, and also wrote and created a video on the weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the week of releasing the thing that I have been building over the span of the past 2 months and really felt good this Thursday to release it. Tested it and worked perfectly, now on to a new set of experiments and building on top of the thing in the upcoming weeks or months even, exciting times ahead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building Golang from Source v1.23 and Above</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-build-from-source-1-24-above/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 23:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-build-from-source-1-24-above/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This week was really productive, was able to make the code I have been writing for the past 2 months and experiments that have been doing into a deployable and ready to launch code. I finally feel a bit satisfied by my efforts, feel the motivation back, the curiosity back. I had an intense focus or flow state this week, I did not create any content this week as I was out on Sunday and was really tired on Saturday.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #15</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-15/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-15">Week #15&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A wonderful week, bringing back the joy of programming, after some slumpy weeks, a refreshing and mind challenging week. The start was drowzy after a long weekend, but as the week progressed, I had to shift gears and complete the things that took some deep concentration and thinking, finally the results were worth the efforts. Everything in its place, the reward for the focus and hard work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a live stream and video creation in the end of week last week, I didn’t do much on Sunday, just took a break and spent the diwali removing the negativity in life. I am not mentioning it enough but I continue the writing routine, 35 days and counting, the writing streak is un-broken, I completed one section of writing of 21 days and now moving on to another section of 17 days, combining a total of (9+21+5(till date)) 35 articles. This is the motivation for me waking up everyday, writing will get me to the places I can dream of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #14</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-14/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-14/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-14">Week #14&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was an excellent week, I created one video, posted one article, did a live stream setup went live for an hour on Twitch and Youtube, and did some exercise as well—writing of course with the 4th consecutive week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The week was super-productive to start with, like I had a dream Sunday, I went on a walk in the morning, 6:30 AM, right? I have been procrastinating for months, but finally started doing since this Sunday. And I cannot say how much benefit I had from these walks like there is some energy flowing in me after I come from the walk. There is the fire ignited back, the curiosity flying back, the spark is back and with the habits like this newsletter and others in place, It looks like a dream routine, and it gets better and better.

&lt;p>This was a pretty rough week, some mundane tasks at work, not that mundane but felt off track on the mind. Nothing going on in my life, just that the past things that have happened have slowed down and now feel the sense of pain and consequences in the future. Don’t know what I am talking really, but as always there is hope in me, I am continuing to write a mythological blog of mine for almost 21 days which is 3 weeks, yes that is a daily one post. At least some things in life are good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #12</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-12/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-12/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-12">Week #12&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week, was a bit of a realization that I need to improve as a junior developer, I need to do something important and exciting. These past few months have been tiring mentally, but need to up the effort and get some serious business rolling in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will be looking to write more articles based on the videos I create in the upcoming months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I worked a bit harder than usual, to do my two modes of being. One as a developer, and the other as a writer, I have been writing non-fictional, spiritual, and mythological writing on the side for almost 2 weeks now. I feel really positive, I am able to get things done quickly and appreciate life more gratefully.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #11</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-11/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-11/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-11">Week #11&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week was good in terms of writing. I started a new endeavor: a blog. It is not technical; it is related to mythology and finding its meaning in the modern world. I kept a consistent writing routine for nine days. Nine posts in nine days looks like a good start for my writing routine. I will try to continue this routine throughout the month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moving on to the technical things, I wrote a lot less code than usual but read a lot of code for debugging and understanding existing flows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #10</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-10/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-10/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-10">Week #10&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Wrapping up the third quarter with a burst of energy! This week felt more mentally demanding, but as the week closed, I realized that even small progress is still progress. Sometimes, numbers don’t tell the whole story—they can shift perceptions or even mislead. I believe in valuing the journey more than the destination, and this week’s coding, learning, and creating was worth more than any metric can show.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connect LibSQL Database hosted on Turso in a Golang Application</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/turso-libsql-db-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 23:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/turso-libsql-db-golang/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This week was a bit mentally tough but technically productive, pushed some efforts to get the project up and integrated fully and tested it out. Not good with the numbers but overall, that looked promising, and again excited for next week’s challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week is special because I created and uploaded my first YouTube video! On Sunday, I did everything from recording to creating the thumbnail, voiceover, and editing. It took about six hours for a six-minute video, but it’s a solid start for future videos.

&lt;p>This week was all about diving deep into the details of my projects. After weeks of building, I spent this week debugging and testing everything, pushing things to the next level. My goal was to have a working demo by the end of the week, which I started on Wednesday—and I’m happy to report that I almost hit the mark. There’s always room for improvement, but the testing phase went as planned, and the hypothesis is holding up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Safely using Maps in Golang: Differences in declaration and initialization</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-safely-using-maps/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-safely-using-maps/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week, I was working on one of the API wrapper packages for golang, and that dealt with sending post requests with URL encoded values, setting cookies, and all the fun stuff. However, while I was constructing the body, I was using &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#Values">url.Value&lt;/a> type to construct the body, and use that to add and set key-value pairs. However, I was getting a wired &lt;code>nil&lt;/code> pointer reference error in some of the parts, I thought it was because of some of the variables I set manually. However, by debugging closer, I found out a common pitfall or bad practice of just declaring a type but initializing it and that causing &lt;code>nil&lt;/code> reference errors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #5</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-5/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-5">Week #5&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I also managed to get the side project of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/meta-ai-golang">Meta AI API wrapper&lt;/a> in Golang correctly, over the weekend will polish this project and also fix the bug in the Chat GPT anonymous client in Python.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #4</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="techstructive-weekly-4">Techstructive Weekly #4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was an exhilarating week for me, learned a lot of stuff, wrote a lot of code, pushed a lot of bugs, and tweeted a lot. This week, I wrote a lot of Python scripts at my work for experimentation setup and testing a lot of things, I was learning and prototyping my idea of Audiofy with Appwrite cloud, and read some inspiring articles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p> The week was really tiring for me for some reasons, was not able to work on the side projects. I actually spent some time with my family and cousin who came over the weeks for festivals. However, on the work side of things, I was able to learn a few things about NGINX, pdf parsing and product specific features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The upcoming week(end) will be actually fun, as I finally have some free time to write some blogs, hopefully will be able to have some things to showcase and share next week about the things I explored or failed at those things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #2</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="week-2">Week #2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week I made some mistakes at my job (well they were the week before) but they got caught after the review. I learned how powerful reviews could be at catching flaws in code. I also caught a bug while pair programming, it was a mixed feeling as a developer for me this week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, I would recommend debugging your code thrice, yes not once, not twice but thrice, and also make sure to forcefully make the code flow reach the section of your changes, if that is a bit of an edge case thing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Techstructive Weekly #1</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-weekly-1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="week-1">Week #1&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This week, I had a ton of fun on the side as I finally made the MVP of a side project. An SSG with a Content Management System-like interface. an SSG with an editor that syncs up the posts from a database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this process, I learned about Cloudflare workers and golang. At work, I had some thinking and experimentation with LLMs.&lt;/p>

This section will guide you through the essential tasks of setting up a basic HTTP server, configuring NGINX to serve content from custom directories, and using it as a reverse proxy to forward requests to backend servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NGINX is a versatile web server that can be used to serve applications in a variety of ways, from simple web servers to complex proxy configurations. NGINX can be used to serve static HTML content, proxy requests to a backend server, or load balance traffic across multiple servers. In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the different ways to use NGINX to serve applications, including setting up a simple HTTP server, serving content from custom directories, and using it to load balance traffic across multiple upstream servers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang Web: PUT Method</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-web-put-method/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-web-put-method/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The year 2023 was a pivotal year for me to gain experience in solving and delivering real-world problems to solutions. I went from a code-first approach to a code-last approach for solving a problem. The year was not ideal for freshers, as from the end of 2022 till 2023 there was a huge round of layoffs in big tech companies.

&lt;p>A golang Channel is like a pipe that lets goroutines communicate. It lets you pass values from one goroutine to another. Channels are typed i.e. you declare them with &lt;code>chan&lt;/code> keyword followed by the type to be sent and received (e.g. &lt;code>chan int&lt;/code>). The &lt;code>chan&lt;/code> type specifies the type of values that will be passed through the channel. We will explore the detailed technicalities soon.

&lt;p>In the 27th post of the series, we will be looking into random number generation in golang. We will be exploring how to create a random number, generate random numbers within a range, shuffle slices/arrays, and generate random strings, float, and bytes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two types of random number generation processes in software pseudo-random numbers and cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand">math/rand&lt;/a> package in Golang provides a number of functions for generating pseudorandom numbers. These functions are suitable for a variety of applications, such as games, simulations, and to some extent in cryptography.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MindsDB Golang SDK(Client)</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/mindsdb-go-sdk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/mindsdb-go-sdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Golang Client (Wrapper) for the MindsDB API.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this article, we will be creating a Django project, which will be a chat-room kind of application. The user needs to authenticate to the app and then and there he/she can create or join rooms, every room will have some name and URL associated with it. So, the user simply needs to enter the name of the room, which will be unique. The user can then simply enter the messages in the chat room. This is a core chat application that uses web sockets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Command Line Arguments</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-command-line-args/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 21:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-command-line-args/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the 25th post of the series, we will be taking a look into parsing of command line arguments in golang. We will be exploring how to do the basics of parsing and using the positional parameters or arguments from the command line in the program. By using standard library packages like &lt;code>os&lt;/code> and &lt;code>flag&lt;/code>, we can make powerful yet easy-to-build CLI apps and programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="parsing-arguments-from-the-command-line-os-package">Parsing Arguments from the command line (os package)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We can use the os package to get the arguments from the command line in a go script. We have to use the Args variable in the os package. The &lt;code>Args&lt;/code> variable is a slice of strings which thereby is the parsed arguments from the command line.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2022: Year Review</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2022-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 12:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/2022-review/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, what a year! If 2021 was a start, 2022 was a year to convert a start into a goal. From collaborating on open-source projects to getting an internship, it was an exciting year! Created a couple dozen of projects(not finished as usual), wrote 40+ articles, did a couple of streams, learned the basics of golang, and spend 6 months as a backend dev intern at &lt;a href="https://thesolarlabs.com/">Solarlabs&lt;/a>, just a year that was awaited for the hard work over the span of 2 years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: File Write</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-file-write/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 15:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-file-write/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the 24th post of the series, we will be taking a look at how we can perform write operations to a file using golang. We will be using the &lt;code>os&lt;/code> package in most operations along with &lt;code>bufio&lt;/code> text manipulations. We will be performing write operations like appending, deleting, and replacing a file using golang. We will be heavily leveraging standard library packages like &lt;code>os&lt;/code>, &lt;code>bufio&lt;/code>, &lt;code>bytes&lt;/code> and &lt;code>fmt&lt;/code>. We will also be looking into overwriting and string formatting to a file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Read a Rss Feed with a URL in Golang</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-read-rss-feed/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 22:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-read-rss-feed/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="reding-rss-feed">Reding Rss Feed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We can use golang&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/xml">encoding/xml&lt;/a> package to read a Rss feed. Though we have to be speicific of what type of structure the Rss feed has, so it is not dynamic but it works really well with structs. I have covered a few nuances of reading XML file in the &lt;a href="https://www.meetgor.com/golang-config-file-read/#reading-xml-file">config file reading&lt;/a> post of the 100 days of golang series.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A non-clustered index is a seperate structure than an actual table in the database, it stores the non-clustered index key(the column which we want to sort in the table), and a pointer to the actual values based on the index key. So, non-clustered indexes do not change the physical order of the table records, instead it holds a structure that can provide a easier and distinct way to fetch objects based on a particular column as the primary key in the structure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: JSON YAML TOML (config) File Reading.</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-config-file-read/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-config-file-read/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="reading-specific-file-types-json-yaml-toml">Reading specific file types (JSON, YAML, TOML)&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In the 21st post of the series, we will be exploring the file paths in golang, we will be exploring how we can deal with paths. By using packages like &lt;code>os&lt;/code>, &lt;code>path&lt;/code>, &lt;code>io&lt;/code>, we can work with file systems and operating system-specific details. In this section, we will see how to resolve paths, details from paths, extract relative or absolute paths, iterate over file systems, etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Error handling is quite an important feature of any programming language to improve the quality and transparency between the user and the application. By raising appropriate error messages, the user can get a clear idea about the things happening in the interface as well as the application can handle the errors with appropriate actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 20th post of the series, we will be exploring the concept of error handling in golang. From this article, we will be able to learn the fundamentals of error or exception handling in golang, create custom error classes, raise and ignore error messages, and exit or redirect the flow of state of the application when an error is raised.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Pipreqs: Generate requirements file from the imported packages</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/python-pipreqs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 21:57:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/python-pipreqs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In the 19th post of the series, we will be taking a look into interfaces in golang. Interfaces allow us to create function signatures common to different structs or types. So, we can allow multiple structs to have a common interface(method) that can have different implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-interfaces">What are Interfaces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Interface as the name suggests is a way to create methods that are common to different structures or types but can have different implementations. It&amp;rsquo;s an interface to define the method or function signatures but not the implementation. Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example of &lt;code>Laptop&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Phone&lt;/code> having the functionality of wifi. We can connect to wifi more or the less in a similar way on both devices. The implementation behind the functionality might be different but they share the same operation. The WiFi can act as an interface for both devices to connect to the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Closures</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-closures/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-closures/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the previous part of the series, we covered &lt;a href="https://meetgor.com/golang-anonymous-functions/">anonymous functions&lt;/a> and in this section, we will look into &lt;code>closures&lt;/code> which are quite a cool concept for various things. Closures are basically a function that returns a function instead of a value, so basically we will leverage anonymous functions for creating closures.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="simple-closures">Simple Closures&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A simple closure can be constructed for understanding how we can use closures in golang. We will return a function from a function, that is a simple closure. So, in the below code example, we have created a function &lt;code>gophy()&lt;/code> which takes no parameters but returns a function that returns a &lt;code>string&lt;/code>. The function simply returns an anonymous function that returns a string.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PGCLI: Postgres from the terminal</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/pgcli-pg-from-terminal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/pgcli-pg-from-terminal/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Have you ever used the Postgres database and did you know you don&amp;rsquo;t have to launch PGAdmin every time you want to write SQL queries, you can write down those queries even inside a terminal with a python package. It&amp;rsquo;s PGCLI, that can act as an editor window for writing SQL queries for Postgres Databases.

Let&amp;rsquo;s get our feets wet with this ancient but revolutionary methodology of development with &lt;a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Anonymous Functions</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-anonymous-functions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 18:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-anonymous-functions/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have looked at the defer keyword in golang in the &lt;a href="https://www.meetgor.com/golang-defer/">previous&lt;/a> part of the series, in this section, we will understand how we can use anonymous functions in golang. We will explore how to declare and use anonymous functions with a few examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-anonymous-functions">What are Anonymous Functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Anonymous functions are quite simple to understand, we don&amp;rsquo;t define a function, we declare it and call it instantly. An anonymous function doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a name so hence it is called an anonymous function. As a normal function it can take in parameters and return values. With anonymous functions, we can bind the operations to a variable or a constant as a literal(value). If an anonymous function takes in a parameter, it needs to be parsed immediately after the end of the function body. We will see how we define the syntax and specifications of the anonymous functions in golang.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying Django Project with Railway Nixpacks</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-deploy-railway-nixpacks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 16:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-deploy-railway-nixpacks/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have seen how to deploy a Django application on railway app in the &lt;a href="https://www.meetgor.com/django-deploy-railway/">previous article&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="https://www.meetgor.com/series/django-deployment/">series&lt;/a>. We deployed the django project using the Heroku Buildpacks under the hood. The railway app provides a couple of options on how to build your web application. Currently, there are three options, one of which is the &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-20-stack">heroku buildpacks&lt;/a> which is the default one, second, we have the nixpacks which we will see today, and the third is the &lt;a href="https://paketo.io/">Paketo buildpack&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Map Vimscript Keymaps to Lua with a single function</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vimscript-to-lua-keymapper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vimscript-to-lua-keymapper/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Are you bored of writing all the keymaps from vimscript to lua? Try the below function to create all your keymaps to lua equivalent maps in Neovim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take your vimscript keymaps and put them in lua don&amp;rsquo;t write any lua for it ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-lua-function">The Lua Function&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The below-provided snippet is a lua function that takes in a table of strings(list of strings), the strings will be your keymaps. The function then maps these keymaps using lua functions. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to type out all the keymaps by yourself. It can also print out the lua equivalent function calls required to map the existing keymaps from vimscript to lua runtime in Neovim. Though it won&amp;rsquo;t handle all the options, we have passed in a default value to the keymap.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configure Neovim in Lua</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/neovim-vimscript-to-lua/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/neovim-vimscript-to-lua/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It has been a while since I have written a Vim article. Finally, I got some ideas after configuring my Neovim setup for Lua. I recently migrated to Ubuntu a couple of months back and it has been a cool change from Windows 7!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how you can set up neovim for Lua. Since Neovim 0.5, it supports lua out of the box, so in the recent release 0.7, it added more native support to lua making it a lot easier to configure and play with neovim. So, we will see how we can use lua to convert all the 200 liner vimscript into lua (We can even have packages and modules:) We will cover how to configure your keymaps, pull up all the plugins, vim options, and other customizations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Defer</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-defer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-defer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this part of the series, we will be taking a look at the &lt;code>defer&lt;/code> keyword in golang. The defer keyword is used for delaying the function call in a particular block of program(function or a loop).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="defer-keyword">Defer Keyword&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>defer&lt;/code> keyword is an interesting keyword in golang, it basically holds up the execution of the statement until all the statements around the local scope has been executed. It is basically like a stack holding the execution of statements. You can have multiple defer keywords in the single code block(function or a loop), those will be called by the principle of &lt;strong>first in last out&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: String Manipulation</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-strings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-strings/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the 15th post of the Series, we will be looking into the details of the String manipulation and performing types of operations in Golang. We will explore string manipulation, concatenation, helper functions, etc. which will help in working with strings in Golang.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="string-concatenation">String Concatenation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>String Concatenation refers to the combining and formatting of strings in Golang. We can combine multiple strings and formating the way we display the strings in Golang.

&lt;p>In this 14th Post of the 100 days of GOlang, we will be understanding about the mutable and immutable data types in Golang. Firstly, we will understand the concept of mutability and understand the differences in mutable and immutable data types, further we will explore which data types in Golang are Mutable and Immutable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mutable-data-type">Mutable Data Type&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mutable data type is a data type which can be modified without reallocating any chunk of the memory assigned at the time of initialization. In simple words, a variable is mutable if its value can be altered without reallocating itself to a new memory space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lingo</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/lingo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/lingo/</guid><description>&lt;p>A simple link-tree clone in Golang.

&lt;p>We have already seen the process of deployment of a Django app on Heroku, now we can move to another platform which is &lt;a href="https://railway.app">Railway App&lt;/a>. This allows a faster and more intuitive way to deploy a Django app(or any sort of web app). This platform has several &lt;a href="https://railway.app/starters">Starter Apps&lt;/a> for shipping your app in several clicks, definitely, it would require some configuration and tweaking a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will be following similar steps from the &lt;a href="https://mr-destructive.github.io/techstructive-blog/series/django-deployment/">Django-Heroku Deployment Guide&lt;/a> for configuring and setting up our Django project for the deployment on the Railway app. We explore a few different ways to create and deploy a Django project on Railway.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django + PostgreSQL Deployment on Heroku</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-deploy-heroku/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-deploy-heroku/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Django projects are quite easy to build and simple to understand, you might have created a Django application and wanted to show it to the world? You can deploy a basic Django application with a database(PostgreSQL) with Heroku. It provides a decent free tier with some great features and add-ons. A free tier Heroku account has a limitation of 5 apps, limited data in the database, limited connections to the server per month, and so on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Operators</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-operators/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 20:33:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-operators/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this 13th part of the series, we will be exploring the fundamentals of operators in Golang. We will be exploring the basics of operators and the various types like Arithmetic, Bitwise, Comparison, Assignment operators in Golang.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Operators are quite fundamentals in any programming language. Operators are basically expressions or a set of character(s) to perform certain fundamental tasks. They allow us to perform certain trivial operations with a simple expression or character. There are quite a few operators in Golang to perform various operations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Math Package</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-math/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-math/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Moving on in the 100 days of golang series, we can take a look into the math package in golang&amp;rsquo;s standard library. In programming, math is quite critical aspect, we need to perform certain mathematical operations quite regularly so golang&amp;rsquo;s standard library has a package for serving some quite commonly used math functions and procedures. We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at some of the basic and common functions which are available in the math package.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Packages</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-packages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-packages/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this 11th part of the series, we will be covering packages in golang. Package is a cool way to organize code in large projects. We can create a separate file which can include certain helper functions or variables from other files or scripts. There are couple of types of packages like packages from the standard library, open sourced community packages and custom packages that you can build of your own. In this particular section, we will be covering the fundamentals of packages and exploring the standard library in golang.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Pointers</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-pointers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-pointers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the tenth part of the series, we will be looking into an interesting concept in programming i.e. Pointer. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple thing but a really powerful concept. Using pointers we can do several things very easily rather than writing a lot of code for a simple thing. We will be looking into basic concepts like declaration, referencing, de-referencing, and some examples on passing by reference, along with a pointer to struct instances.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Structs</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-structs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 22:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-structs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Moving on to the 9th part of the series, we will be understanding structs in golang. Structs are an important aspect of programming in Golang, they provide a way to define custom types and add functionality to them. We will be understanding the basics of operating on structs like declaration, initialization and adding functional logic into those structs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="structs-in-golang">Structs in Golang&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Structs or Structures in Golang are the sequences or collections of built-in data types as a single type interface. Just like we have int, string, float, and complex, we can define our own data types in golang. They can consist of built-in data types as mentioned and also certain functions or methods which can be used to operate on them. Using structs we can create custom data types that can meet the specific requirements of our problem. We can define structs and later inside functions we can create instances of those structures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Functions</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-functions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-functions/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the eighth part of the series, we will be exploring functions in golang. We will be diving into some basics of functions in golang like declaration, definition and calling. We won&amp;rsquo;t be exploring all the topics of functions as it is quite a large topic to cover in one shot. So, building from the base, we will be starting from the basic declaration to simple return statements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="functions-in-golang">Functions in Golang&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Functions in golang are a simple way to structure a block of code that can be re-usable. Functions also allow us to process a piece of logic and return the output. Functions allow us to write readable and scalable code as we have to write the code once and we can re-use the functionality of it by calling it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Maps</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-maps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-maps/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the seventh part of the series, we will be covering Maps. We have covered some basic data structures like arrays and slices, and now we can move into maps or hash tables. Maps allow us to store key-value pairs of a particular type. In this part of the series, we will be covering the basics of Maps in Golang like declaration, iteration, and Creating, updating, and deleting keys from the map.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Slices</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-slices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-slices/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the sixth part of the series, we will be covering slices. Slices are almost like arrays but have a lot of advantages over them, including flexibility and control over them. We can adjust the size and capacity of the data which we will store at a place using slices. We will be covering basic declaration, initialization, capacity in slices, iteration, and accessing the elements of the slices.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="slices-in-golang">Slices in Golang&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Slices are Arrays but can provide more control and are more flexible than arrays. In slices, we can increase the size of the array/list of elements whenever required. We can even have a capacity for slices i.e. the maximum length we wish to grow the initial slice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Arrays</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-arrays/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-arrays/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this fifth section of Golang, we will be understanding the basics of arrays. We will be covering some basic operations on arrays like declaration, initialization, modifications, and iterating over an array.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="declaring-arrays">Declaring Arrays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Arrays are type of data structure that allow us to store multiple items at continuous memory locations of the same type. In golang, we can create arrays similar to any variable but by adding a few bits and pieces like the &lt;code>[]&lt;/code> square braces, length of the array, values, etc. In golang, we cannot resize the length once it is initialized.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Input</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-input/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-input/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this fourth section of Golang, we will be understanding the basics of user input. In golang, we can get user input with several functions most of which are similar to the &lt;code>C&lt;/code> programming language like &lt;code>scanf&lt;/code>. This type of input is quite powerful and gives more control on the input to be received.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scan-function">Scan Function&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#Scan">Scan&lt;/a> function helps in getting a value with space as delimiter i.e. The input is stored before a space is encountered. This means the input is only limited to adding a space or a new line. We can use the function by passing the reference to the variable we are going to store the input value. So, we can have a basic input in Golang as follows:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Conditionals and Loops</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-conditionals-loops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-conditionals-loops/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Moving to the fourth part, we will be doing conditional statements and loops in golang. We will be seeing the basics of conditional statements like if-else and switch along with loops like for, while, and range-based loops. We won&amp;rsquo;t be covering iterating over arrays in a loop as this requires an understanding of arrays.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conditional-statements">Conditional statements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Conditional statements are quite a fundamental aspect of learning a programming language. In golang, we have if-else conditional statements as well as switch cases. We will be exploring both of them in this section. Firstly, we will dive into if-else statements which are quite easy to understand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Variables and Types</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-variables/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 10:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/golang-variables/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the third part of the series, we will be covering the fundamentals for learning any programming language i.e. variables and data types. We will be covering from data types to variable declaration. We won&amp;rsquo;t be seeing each and every detail related to the data types as some of them require a knowledge of loops and other topics, so that can be left for the different part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="types-in-golang">Types in golang&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In Golang there are 3 major types : Numeric, Bool and String. Further we also have specific types for the three data types like int, float, rune, byte, etc. We will first see how to declare a simple variable and then explore the data types in Golang.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: Installation and Hello-World</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/hello-golang/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 16:36:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/hello-golang/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Moving on to the second day, we will be installing and setting up Go lang on our systems. The installation and setup are quite simple and not much demonstration is required, so further in the article, I will also make a hello-world program in GO. We will explore the basic program in GO and how to compile, run and build a GO program in this section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-go">Installing Go&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Installing Go is pretty straightforward.

&lt;p>This is the first entry in my 100 days of Go lang challenge. I will share the things I will learn each day for 100 days related to Golang or its configuration in my environment. In this post, we will understand what is golang and why you should learn it. It&amp;rsquo;s not an in-depth guide but a high-level overview for understanding the context of learning Go lang.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-bit-of-context">A bit of Context&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In April 2021, I started learning Django and to date, I have more than 10 projects(not all deployed) created and publicly open on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mr-Destructive?tab=repositories&amp;amp;q=django&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=python&amp;amp;sort=">GitHub&lt;/a>. It has been a great experience so far, I am still in between an internship with a project to be created in Django. The learning process after I started blogging in June 2021 has been a different fantasy, I have been enjoying the process of writing the things I learn. So, this Spring/Summer I am creating a challenge of 100 days for learning Go lang and documenting the process.

&lt;p>Using simple python semantics, we can perform search and replace in a file. Firstly, we will define the file name, along with the words to search and replace. After defining the sets of variables, we will open the file in &lt;code>r+&lt;/code> mode i.e. we can perform read as well as write operations in the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will store the entire file contents using the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">read&lt;/a> function, the contents of file are now stored in the form of a string. We further can set the position of the cursor or the current position in the file using the &lt;a href="https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/file/seek.html">seek&lt;/a> function. The seek function takes in a optional parameter as the position to set for reading/writing of file. Using the &lt;a href="https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/file/truncate.html">truncate&lt;/a> function, we can clear all the contents of the file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Feedparser: Python package for reading RSS feeds</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/python-feedparser/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/python-feedparser/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/">Feedparser&lt;/a> is a simple but powerful python package that can be used to extract information about a specific webpage or a publication with its RSS feed(not only RSS). By providing the RSS feed link, we can get structured information in the form of python lists and dictionaries. It can be basically used in a pythonic way to read RSS feeds, it is really simple to use and it even normalizes different types of feeds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pipx: A python package consumption tool for CLI packages</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/pipx-intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2022 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/pipx-intro/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Previously, I explored the &lt;a href="https://mr-destructive.github.io/techstructive-blog/pipenv-intro/">pipenv&lt;/a> as a python package management tool and this week it is time for exploring a python CLI package isolation tool called &lt;code>pipx&lt;/code>. It is a really simple and powerful tool for running commands as an executable from an isolated environment. Those commands should be associated with a python package that has CLI. In pipx, we install the package once and we can use the package anywhere on our system isolated from other virtual environments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pipenv: Python's Official Package Management tool</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/pipenv-intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 14:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/pipenv-intro/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Pipenv is Python&amp;rsquo;s officially recommended Package management tool, as the name suggests it combines the power of &lt;code>pip&lt;/code> and &lt;code>virtualenv&lt;/code>. It is really powerful and gives control of package management for a python project. It also has support for adding dev packages, python versions, smartly recognizing main and derived package installation/uninstallation, and so on. It is the &lt;a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/#managing-dependencies">official package management tool for Python&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is quite similar to npm for Nodejs in Javascript, or bundle for Ruby, cargo for Rust, and so on. It really simple and easy to use as it manages the overhead for package management for us and hence it is also a high-level package management tool as opposed to pip, which is not as powerful as Pipenv. So, in this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">Pipenv&lt;/a> package manager for Python and how you can use it in your next python project. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim: Get the Text from Visual Selection</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-get-visual-text/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 17:25:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-get-visual-text/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="using-registers">Using Registers&lt;/h2>

 | 
 Select the previously selected text 
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Here, we are entering normal mode and selecting text which was previously selected and yank the contents into a register in this case we are using (x) register, it can be any register.
Now to get the contents of that register we can use the function &lt;code>getreg(&amp;quot;register_name&amp;quot;)&lt;/code> or use &lt;code>&amp;quot;xp&amp;quot;&lt;/code> to paste the contents of the &lt;code>x&lt;/code> register or more generally for any register(&lt;code>&amp;quot;&amp;lt;register-name&amp;gt;p&lt;/code>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dockerize a Django project</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/dockerize-django-prj/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 19:12:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/dockerize-django-prj/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="dockerize-a-django-project">Dockerize a Django project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We can run our Django projects in a Docker Container by creating a Docker image for our project. It is really easy and intuitive to create a Dockerfile for any given application as it really is a matter of writing commands in a file and basically running it is a isolated environment. To create a Docker image, we first need a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is simply a Blueprint to create a image in Docker. In this file we specify the instructions/commands/environment variables to create a image for our app to run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docker Port Forwarding</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/docker-port-forward/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 16:44:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/docker-port-forward/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="docker-port-forwarding">Docker Port Forwarding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Port forwarding is a process to redirect the communication of one address to other.
It is also known as Port Binding.
We can use &lt;code>-p&lt;/code> command to use port forwarding in our local Docker environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>docker run -p 8000:8000 django-app
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The first port number is the local machine port and followed by a &lt;code>:&lt;/code> is the container port number.
SO, the request from the container port are forwarded to the local/outside world in the docker environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crossposter</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/crossposter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 16:44:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/crossposter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tech Stack:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After understanding the admin section and setting up a database, we can finally move on to the CRUD API in Django. We will create a API in pure Django with Model Form, Class Based Views and templates. We will go in two parts in this section, first revising the workflow of the app creation and setup, the next part all about CRUD API. We&amp;rsquo;ll dive into a lot of familiar topics and concepts from previous parts but there are is still a lot to learn beyond the basics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BackChat</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/backchat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/backchat/</guid><description>&lt;p>A simple chat/messaging app created for exploring HTMX and django-channels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the previous section, we configured the database in our Django project. We will move ahead and interact with the Admin Section in Django. Django has a built-in Admin Section which we can use to manage our apps and models. We will create a admin account(superuser) and try to render our custom Model in the Admin Interface. We shall further discuss the customization in the Admin section as per our requirements and necessity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django Basics: Database Configurations</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-database-conf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 16:40:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-database-conf/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this part of the series, we will create an external database and configure the settings for that database. We also look into the process of migrations which is to convert a model which we created in the previous part into the actual structure/schema for the database. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using &lt;code>PostgreSQL&lt;/code> for most of the demonstrations but it should be similar for other database management tools. This part will make your Django project link to a local database.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django Basics: Creating Models</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-models/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 22:15:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-models/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have seen the basics of Django templating in the previous parts of the series. Now, we can move on to the more backend stuff in Django which deals with the Databases, queries, admin section, and so on. In this particular part, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the fundamental part of any application in Django i.e the &lt;code>Model&lt;/code>. We&amp;rsquo;ll understand what the model is, how to structure one, how to create relationships and add constraints on the fields, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django Basics: Static Files</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-static-files/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 22:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-static-files/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After creating templates, it should be rather tempting to add some styles and logic to them. Well yes, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to add static files in a web application using django. Static files are not only CSS, but also media/images and Javascript files as well. In this part of the series, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the basics of working with static files in django including the configuration, rendering and storing of the static files.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django Basics: Templates</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-templates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-templates/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After learning the basics of views and URLs, we can now move on to the next concept i.e. Templates. In Django, Templates are quite an important component for the application as it acts as the &lt;code>frontend&lt;/code> for the web application. With the help of templates and some features provided by Django, it becomes very intuitive and simple to make dynamic web content.
In this part, we understand what are templates and what is the way to render them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django Basics: Views and URLS</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-views-urls/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 12:03:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-views-urls/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After getting familiar with the folder structure of the Django framework, we&amp;rsquo;ll create our first view in an app. The basics of creating and mapping a view with a URL will be cleared by the end of this part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-views">Creating Views&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Views are the functions written in python as a logic control unit of the webserver&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To create a view or typically-like function, we need to write a function in the &lt;code>views.py&lt;/code> file inside of the application folder. The function name can be anything but should be a sensible name as far as its usability is concerned. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a basic example of sending an HTTP response of &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django Basics: Folder Structure</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-folder-struct/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-folder-struct/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After setting up the development for the Django framework, we will explore the project structure. In this part, we understand the structure along with the various components in the Project as well as individual apps. We will understand the objective of each file and folder in a brief and hopefully by the end of this part, you&amp;rsquo;ll be aware of how the Django project is structured and get a good overview of the flow of development in the Django project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Django Basics: Setup and Installation</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-setup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 16:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/django-basics-setup/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Welcome to Django Basics series, in this series we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the basics of the Django web framework. In this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll understand what this web framework provides and what actually the back-end development consists of. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss where Django is used and why it is a great choice for beginners as well as experienced developers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We all might have used the curl command but might be unaware of it. It&amp;rsquo;s super old
and still serves a great purpose. It has been available since 1996 and still is
widely used in many embedded technologies, web API testing, CLI applications,
etc. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see some basics of using the curl command along with
its applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-curl-command">What is the curl command?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Curl or cURL command is the utility or tool to access the internet from the command
line interface using various protocols. This looks trivial but it can blow up
your mind! Most people use this tool for fetching and processing the
data from the servers/internet from their terminal without the browser but
there is a lot more to it. It is used in various embedded devices for accessing
the network in a lightweight and accessible way. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how you can use the curl
command from the very basics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crossposting with a single script: Crossposter.sh</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/crossposter-shellscript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 15:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/crossposter-shellscript/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>We all have seen the buzz around web frameworks like Django, Flask, Node.js, etc but have you taken time to learn all of them? No, and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t! Because many web frameworks share the same principle and workflow with a bit of difference. It&amp;rsquo;s just like learning one programming language and applying the same concepts in a different syntax and mechanism. In the world of web frameworks, this is the case as well, but most of them will disagree with it as every web framework is unique in its design and that&amp;rsquo;s true, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comment/Uncomment Code: Vim for Programmers</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-un-comment-p1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 16:45:42 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-un-comment-p1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

This won&amp;rsquo;t be a perfect guide in terms of experience but surely enough to get anyone through the basics of Machine Learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not the kind of article I write but, having such challenges can help me become a better technical writer, this is the challenge put forward in the Hashnode Bootcamp 4 to get out of my comfort zone.

&lt;p>This is a guide and a walkthrough of how to quickly set up a base Django project with Auth0 as integration for authentication and authorization. I will walk you through the Django setup and how to use and integrate the functionalities of the Auth0. I will also discuss how why you should be using Auth0 and why I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The script takes &lt;code>2:44&lt;/code> minutes time to do everything from scratch.

&lt;p>After learning a bit about classes, objects, and access modifiers, we can move on to another important concept of Constructors and Destructors. This part will cover Constructors. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore what are constructors, why we need them, types of constructors, and their semantics in C++ as usual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So without wasting any time, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-constructor">What is a constructor&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A constructor is a method just like another method in a class, but it has a special name for a reason. The name itself speaks, &lt;code>Constructor&lt;/code>, which will get called just after the object gets created. A constructor is just a method but it should only have the name same as of the class, that&amp;rsquo;s the thing that distinguishes it from other methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What's in Techstructive Blog</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-blog-init/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 15:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/techstructive-blog-init/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Moving on to Part 2 of Object-Oriented Programming in C++, we will look into the concept of access modifiers which we skipped in the first section. This won&amp;rsquo;t be a comprehensive guide on access modifiers as it requires some other concepts like &lt;code>Inheritance&lt;/code> which we will introduce in the next few sections. This series will be like connecting the pieces of OOP together and building a good foundation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this part, we will discuss the access modifiers and their related concepts.

&lt;p>We all know that C++ is famously known for Object-Oriented Programming, but what is Object-Oriented Programming? Well, this is the article, where we will explore the basics of Object-Oriented Programming, its building blocks i.e Classes and Objects, and get familiar with its basic semantics in C++. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it straight away!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-object-oriented-programming">What is Object-Oriented Programming?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is a way to structure and design a program or an application. Object-Oriented Programming deals with creating classes and objects and it&amp;rsquo;s related terminologies. OOP helps in following the principles like DRY(Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) and KISS(Keep it Simple Stupid). Using OOP certain applications and problems can be solved in a simple and efficient way. It helps in better understanding and readability of the code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GeeksForGeeks</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/geeks-for-geeks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/geeks-for-geeks/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="technical-content-writer---geeksforgeekshttpswwwgeeksforgeeksorg">Technical Content Writer - &lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksForGeeks&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Hello World! I am Meet Gor, a self-taught web developer, Linux enthusiast, and a newbie technical writer. I am currently studying in an Engineering college pursuing my B. Tech in I.T. I love to explore new programming languages and technologies, create innovative projects, love to write stories and blogs like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-it-started">How it started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I was learning Vim, I found the need to write some kind of cheatsheet for myself. So I started writing it, soon I realized I had written a kind of an article instead of a cheatsheet XD There were a lot of chunks of it unorganized but meaningful in some sense. So, from there I started to research on article writing. I found the term perfect for my techno feelings to express i.e. &amp;ldquo;Technical Writing&amp;rdquo;. I soon landed on Hashnode, I knew Medium, GeeksforGeeks but found Hashnode absolutely perfect and much more viable to the creativity of an author.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim for Competitive Programming</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-for-cp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 17:42:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-for-cp/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Vim is not a bad text editor when it comes to using it for Competitive Programming. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of one way or the other, you would love it or you could trash it as it can waste a tremendous amount of time to write code every time. But once you are in a decent setup including some key-bindings and plugins can improve your speed in using Vim. I personally have used it since the beginning and haven&amp;rsquo;t regretted it even a tiny bit till date. It&amp;rsquo;s a flawless and enjoyable experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve used C++ for my CP journey, C is quite similar as well, but C++ has more library support and is a bit easier to write comparatively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filter and Find an Issue on GitHub</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/find-filter-github-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 17:42:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/find-filter-github-issues/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>So, Why would one use Vim? As Vim being the most complicated Text editor when it comes to &lt;strong>closing it&lt;/strong>!! Also, people think it&amp;rsquo;s not worth the time or it&amp;rsquo;s just not their type of Text Editor. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s true, I am not forcing anyone to use Vim, just to tell the reasons why people use Vim. Again, it&amp;rsquo;s not to show off to anyone that I use Vim, just to appreciate the power of Vim and its community, it&amp;rsquo;s just amazing!!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim: NERDTree</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-nerdtree/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 20:45:06 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-nerdtree/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree&lt;/a> is a great plugin in Vim for managing and navigating Files.

&lt;p>Once you learn something very neatly and understand it very clearly, it feels like you are wasting time doing things over and over again. Same things in setting up a Django project, you feel like you could save those typing minutes by making a script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, we will make a script a batch script for windows and a BASH script for Linux/macOS. We will make a virtual environment using python and then install the libraries and dependencies like in this case we will install Django. You can also tinker with these scripts and install other dependencies if you want like Django rest framework, crispy forms, markdown, Redis, etc. We will also make a Django project using the positional parameter passed before running the script from the command line.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim: Buffers</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-buffers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 20:24:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-buffers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have talked about Vim &lt;a href="https://mr-destructive.github.io/techstructive-blog/vim/2021/08/03/Vim-Tabs.html">tabs&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://mr-destructive.github.io/techstructive-blog/vim/2021/08/06/Vim-Window-Splits.html">window splits&lt;/a> in the previous articles, and now I am quite keen on explaining the finest unit of file that you can open using Vim and that is a buffer. Tabs are a collection of windows, Windows are the viewport on buffers (collection to view the buffers), and Buffers are the memory that holds text in the file. So let us explore buffer in detail. This article won&amp;rsquo;t cover each and every tiny detail about buffers but surely enough to make you understand what a buffer is and how to manage those.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim: Window Splits</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-window-splits/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 15:40:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-window-splits/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Have you ever been stuck in Vim opening multiple files within a single window? Didn&amp;rsquo;t anyone tell you, you can create multiple windows and split them within a single tab. Definitely, the window splits will be in separate buffers. In this way you can create multiple windows inside of a single Tab, what are Tabs? You can learn some basics about it from my previous article about &lt;a href="https://mr-destructive.github.io/techstructive-blog/vim/2021/08/03/Vim-Tabs.html">Tabs in Vim&lt;/a>. We can either create Vertical or Horizontal splits within the window making it flexible to work with multiple files in Vim. This article will look into the creation, navigation, closing, and rearrangement of Window Splits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim: Tabs</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-tabs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 20:23:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-tabs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, you are playing with Vim and getting good at but something pulls you off. Basically can&amp;rsquo;t get used to switching between files or windows, and that&amp;rsquo;s totally fine. Some may prefer using Window splitting, file managers, and whatnot. But let me introduce you to TABS in Vim. A simple and elegant way to open multiple files in Vim.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="opening-tabs">Opening Tabs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To open a tab, you can press &lt;code>:tabnew&lt;/code> or &lt;code>:tabedit&lt;/code> to open a blank Tab with no file open in it. This basically works like the &lt;code>:e&lt;/code> command, which opens a buffer for you with no named file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scrapping the meaning of a word from dictionary.com using BASH script.</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-dictionary-scrapper/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 11:45:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-dictionary-scrapper/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Web Scraping is quite an interesting and powerful tool or skill to have in a Programmer&amp;rsquo;s toolkit. It helps in analyzing data and getting some information in various formats. Web Scraping is a process in which a user fetches a website&amp;rsquo;s content using some pattern in those HTML tags and the desired content to be fetched or scraped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this article, we aim to fetch the meaning of a word entered by the user from the dictionary.com website. We need to print just the meaning of the word from the HTML tags in it.

&lt;p>Editing/ Writing is a crucial part of any text editor, the swiftness with which one can make changes in a file(s) or a structure is a bit dependent on the editor we use as well. Vim can be a bit hassle for beginners in the initial stage but it becomes second nature soon. It also depends majorly on the level of usage and the area of usage. If you are an advanced programmer, you will use these commands extensively, and might not be a big deal for you, But for a beginner, it might take some time to get used to the workflow in Vim.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cryptocurrency Price Scrapping using BASH and Coingecko API</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-crypto-scrapper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 17:56:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-crypto-scrapper/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Vim was made to work with the command line. Many beginners do not understand what are the true capabilities of Vim, myself included:) Vim can run terminal commands without leaving the text editor, open an instance of a terminal, work with shell environments, and other things depending on the use case.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="running-terminal-shell-commands-from-within-vim">Running Terminal/ shell commands from within Vim&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can run the commands from inside of Vim by just using &lt;code>:!&lt;/code> before the command, this means you have to be in command mode. Just after being in command mode, the ! or bang operator will execute the command typed after it from the terminal(Linux/ macOS) or your default shell(Windows -&amp;gt; CMD/Powershell).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim: Enhancing Movement Speed</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-movement-speed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 15:27:05 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-movement-speed/</guid><description>&lt;p>![]({{ page.image | relative_url }})&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OK! Vim and movement are like bread and butter or failed brakes. To become a proficient Vim user, you need to move in Vim very effectively. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to think about doing certain things, your fingertips should automatically move without wasting time thinking about it. I am sure, it takes time and effort but OH! it is so rewarding in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-h-j-k-l">Why H J K L?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First things first, unmap arrow keys and make a habit of using h,j,k, and l. Yes, this would not make any sense in the initial stage but that will make no sense for not using it later.
The thing with H J K L is that they are quite flexible to work with and if you use it with numbers you would navigate much faster than arrow keys. Such as &lt;code>10j&lt;/code> will move you 10 lines down at a time in normal mode. These keys are used with many of the other key shortcuts and commands which just make it most important to begin learning to move around in Vim with H J K L.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BASH Scripting Guide - PART - 1</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-guide-p1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 16:37:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-guide-p1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>

BASH is a short term of Bourne-Again Shell, it is a shell interface that has much more capabilities and functions than the simple Bourne shell(sh). It has some quite remarkable features and it is even capable of calling itself a programming language in some sense.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is BASH?</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-intro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 02:12:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/bash-intro/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>BASH or Bourne Again Shell is an interface(program) between the user and the Operating System. BASH is just an application just like others, but not an ordinary one. It is quite powerful when used to its potential. It is used in various aspects of computing. No, it&amp;rsquo;s not only for server admins, but it specializes in that field though. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how we can use Bash to perform several tasks quite powerfully. Not just automation, you&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised what Bash is capable of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim: Keymapping Guide</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-keymaps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 15:27:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-keymaps/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Keymapping or Key binding is a process in which a user or a system can assign certain keys or commands to perform a particular task or commands. This can be quite useful in Vim as well as in other text editors to avoid some repetitive tasks and save time. In Vim this can be a great power to have for programmers as it can be really very flexible to set up for any programming language and it&amp;rsquo;s
environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting up Vim for BASH Scripting</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-for-bash/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 04:52:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-for-bash/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vim-and-bash">Vim and BASH?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Bash Scripting is a powerful skill to have as a programmer because we find Linux almost everywhere and to get through it you must have a command over its interface which is generally the BASH shell. Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on &amp;ldquo;Vim features&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting up Vim for Python</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-for-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 11:35:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-for-python/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Vim is quite a powerful text editor which can add performance to the already fast typed language Python. Vim can be highly customizable and efficient to use as it has the power of &lt;strong>adding custom plugins and plugins managers, key mappings&lt;/strong>, and the most critical weapon of vim - Access to the terminal straight away.
This is not a full-featured guide of using vim for python, it&amp;rsquo;s just a quick setup for using python on vim blazingly fast!!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why and How to make and use Vim as a text editor and customizable IDE</title><link>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-text-editor-ide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 15:05:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://notes-meetgor-com.vercel.app/posts/vim-text-editor-ide/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all are asked to use visual studio code and other rich looking editors as a beginners text editor or an IDE but that makes a habit of a rich and pleasing interface of running and debugging programs, and that is the reason we don&amp;rsquo;t feel good to use command line or the terminal. Terminal or Command line are quite important to learn and are powerful as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vim is a text editor, not any text editor but a special and one of the fastest out there if you use it wisely. Vim can be used in the terminal which means it can run terminal commands inside the editor interface. That makes it quite a great option to improve your terminal command skills and also for enhancing your Linux knowledge. You can run program files from vim itself just with a few keystrokes. This text editor is preinstalled in most Linux distributions and hence you could quickly edit some files without going anywhere.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
