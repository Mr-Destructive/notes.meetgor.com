and still serves a great purpose. It has been available since 1996 and still is&lt;br&gt;
widely used in many embedded technologies, web API testing, CLI applications,&lt;br&gt;
etc. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see some basics of using the curl command along with&lt;br&gt;
its applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-curl-command"&gt;What is the curl command?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curl or cURL command is the utility or tool to access the internet from the command&lt;br&gt;
line interface using various protocols. This looks trivial but it can blow up&lt;br&gt;
your mind! Most people use this tool for fetching and processing the&lt;br&gt;
data from the servers/internet from their terminal without the browser but&lt;br&gt;
there is a lot more to it. It is used in various embedded devices for accessing&lt;br&gt;
the network in a lightweight and accessible way. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how you can use the curl&lt;br&gt;
command from the very basics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
