&lt;li&gt;what a flashback, everything makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming is not mechanical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yet people tried hard to make solve for it as it was mechanical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COBOL made syntax readable. CASE tools eliminated typing. Visual tools eliminated syntax. AI can now generate entire functions from descriptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each advancement addressed a real friction point. Yet the fundamental challenge persists because it’s not mechanical. It’s intellectual. Software development is thinking made tangible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just sheer facts those two. We need to find a way around using AI not away from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don't Fall into the ANTI AI HYPE</title><link>/posts/dont-fall-into-the-anti-ai-hype/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:34:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dont-fall-into-the-anti-ai-hype/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is interesting and it comes at the right time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the social solution, then? Innovation can&amp;rsquo;t be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On not using Django in 2026 due to AI?</title><link>/posts/on-not-using-django-in-2026/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/on-not-using-django-in-2026/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t quite get it. Maybe its true. Django provided a good start but then it was like a lock in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With LLMs its quite easy to generate the boilerplatey code that django provides out of the box, so that demand is lost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its not the only reason django is here right? It has extensions, best python community and even more best documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it will be the best framework to build with LLMs in the future if the ecosystem continues to improve&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fear is not advocacy</title><link>/posts/ai-advocacy-should-not-be-fear-or-fomo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:46:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ai-advocacy-should-not-be-fear-or-fomo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is real advice. People are hyping about the next workflow to 100x our productivity. Its ok to be 1x and still push less bugs than 100x and push 1000 bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The fear of not growing due to AI</title><link>/posts/fear-of-not-growing-due-to-ai/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:18:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/fear-of-not-growing-due-to-ai/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ah! This is a developer trying to love his craft, yet the people are cruel to not respect it. They just want to solve problems; no one cares, they are right, but empathy is traded for business value.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GitHub - davidfowl/tally: Let agents classify your bank transactions.</title><link>/posts/tally-transaction-ai-tool/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:29:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/tally-transaction-ai-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A cool tool to check how it made it&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
