Maybe its just me, but sometimes, the terminal interfaces are different, sometimes they are a bit wired, I use Ghostty right now, so selection without tmux works a charm, but the moment I am in tmux, ahmm, it kind of breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection of text doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with the mouse atleast, so I thought, I need a keyboard centric selection and copying mechanism, and dug in this rabit hole. Turns out, tmux is way better in selection then zellij, the multiplexer I had been using due to scroll and selection issues in terminal interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
