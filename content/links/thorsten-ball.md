## Context

6. [I read more than I write, do you?](https://enombic.com/read-more-than-write)
    1. Yes, this is true for me too. Reading needs to be more or rather at certain point, balanced from writing.
    2. You can’t just keep on reading and produce nothing. You will have to reflect on what you have consumed. This newsletter is exactly that.
    3. After I got a full time job, I suddenly had a lot of time, I realized i needed to dump my learning somewhere and I was following Register Spill by Thorsten Ball and quickly felt the urge to log my reading and interesting things I find throughout the week. There were a lot of things, I took for granted, they got lost and most of the things didn’t stick. I started this and it helped me realize the ample amount of time I have to learn, explore and tinker on stuff. It was liberating. Hence writing the 72nd edition of this. Its fun.
