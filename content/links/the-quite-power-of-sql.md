## Context

It conveys that taking a break from the normal chore, brings a fresh perspective and unclogs the brain. It helps your brain get out of the rut, it shows you a new hope, it fires a kindle of hope and curiosity. I guess, stopping to code, or writing some code if you haven’t been due to AI, just do what you wanted to do, but something or the other kept bugging you. Because when the heart and mind are in sync, impossible becomes possible. [The quite power of SQL](https://blog.sturdystatistics.com/posts/sql/)- This is true. After all, sometimes, not all new tools are worth using all the time. Sometimes, maybe often times, we need to keep it simple and use the good’ol trusted tools, the simplest ones just like SQL, the dc calculator, how LLMs are using the existing tools to create wide possibilities. [How to demo](https://thorstenball.com/how-to-demo/)- Some great advice on how to demo. It has some good catches. Keeping it shorter, slowly moving to the solution, not banging it in the start. Let the viewer understand the problem in its entirety then develop the intuition to your solution.
