  were summoned to their manager Gary''s office before the caffeine had even hit their
  brain.


  Gary glowered up from his office chair as Chops entered. This wasn''t looking good.
  "We need to talk about the latest commit for Taskmaster."

# Myopic Focus

## Context

Wow! Fantastical and Tech stories, are my love. Gist of the story is people are very myopic(viewing in very hindsight) about system and think of the existing workflow as ritualistic that makes it harder for others to make it better or even improve the quality or realibility. The story goes like > A new developer chops replaced fragile ID pool logic with robust UUIDs, eliminating inevitable crashes. But their manager fixated solely on declining unit test numbers, demanded rollback. It made the project a bit risky to sustain, but the fault is not of developers. Its the myopic view that causes it.
