## Context

[The State of Authentication](https://youtu.be/lxslnp-ZEMw?si=NHEnmYD5AVQUHOM0)
    - This is so messed up. There are actually three parts in Authentication. I thought Authentication and Authorization, that’s it
    - Authentication is basically “Am I who I say I am?”
    - Authorisation is what I am allowed to do (if i am who I say I am)\
    - Now the third part of Authentication
    - Auth UI: Lo behold, UIs are not my thing, and yes Auth0 and some other probably some other services too.

- [Andrej Karapathy: Software is Changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ)
    - We are in Software 3.0 Era
    - Software 1.0 was code | Software 2.0 was Neural Networks
    - Now we are in the LLM space, were we can send prompts to neural networks that can generate programs, that is wild idea
    - We need to create systems around LLMs, like interface to interact LLMs, He puts it like we are in the 1960s era of Computing. Where the computers were not personal, they were mainframe, large machines that fit on factories.
    - However the LLMs today are like those big gigantic computers that live in the cloud running in multiple clusters of GPUs, though we have local LLMs, the quality and accuracy of high parameter models is not near the local small sized models (they are improving). So we are reliant on Cloud inference like ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral, LLaMA, Gemini, etc.
    - He relates the transition of LLMs with the augmentation to an autonomous agent. This is compared to Iron Man’s suite, which is a mixture of human control along with AI assistance. When he is outside the augmented mode, its his instinct that help him navigate, however, in the agent mode, the AI decides the track.
    - Also the vibe coding term was emphasised which has a Wikipedia entry. Vibe coding is easy to do because we don’t care about the code, we care about the outcome, we can call it product driven prompting. And it makes sense when he said, we need to increase the Human-verification and AI-generation loop. It doesn’t mean, you’ll tell AI to one-shot the entire thing, instead go bit by bit, one thing and one action and feedback at a time.

- [99% of the AI Startups will be Dead by 2026](https://youtu.be/I10_O47P7Zs?si=umAME2_EUvj97uY8)
    - Obivious, Startup is about survival and if all of them are wrappers around just a LLM they might die. But only if they are just that and nothing else. Turns out most startups might just be that.
    - However, many unicorns and valuable startups are built due to trust and alignment of the problem solved by the product and faced by their users, so its about competition there.
    - AI is here to stay and evolve, if the product keeps adapting, it will survive no matter what, the trend is, if people like it, people will pay to use it for comfort.

- Why Internet went down for 2.5 hours on 12th-13th June 2025 (IST Timings)
    - Half of the internet was down for almost 2.5 hours, due to Google Cloud outage.
    - Cloudflare was down due to one service of theirs was reliant on Google Cloud, and that spiralled to all other services. Whoa! dependency hell is real.
