# A blog, If you can keep it

**Link:** https://fly.io/blog/a-blog-if-kept/

## Context

- [A blog, If you can keep it](https://fly.io/blog/a-blog-if-kept/)  
  Getting a blog post featured at hackernews, hmm, I always wonder how a post gets featured at hackernews, does the author submit it to the site, or the community post it there? Really curious about the working of it.
