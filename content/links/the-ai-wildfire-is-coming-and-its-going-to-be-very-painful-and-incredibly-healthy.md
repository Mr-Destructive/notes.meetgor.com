  will clear the brush, redistribute talent, and leave infrastructure to power what
  comes next. The question is: what kind of plant are you?'

## Context

A beautifully written comparison of natural phenomena to the current situation. The reset of nature as wildfire is really needed in Tech for AI to seed its place. It would burn the hype and leave behind it some mess and blessings that people who struggled here will clean up and reap the benefits. I don’t have much to say, a lot to say rather. I recommend just reading it, it gave me calmness, it’ll be just fine. AI is not coming to burn you, don’t worry, but there will be a new resource at our disposal. You know it, it has its pros and cons, the AI chat.
