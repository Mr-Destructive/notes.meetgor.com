# You cannot outsource understanding

**Link:** https://russmiles.substack.com/p/you-cannot-outsource-understanding

## Context

So true, this is relief bringer post. People tried replacing developers so many times, yet here we are. Cleaning the vibe coded slop We had assembly to programming language to no-code platforms, and now AI. They all wanted to outsource the burden of managing or working with developers but eventually they end up in more of those. Are software engineers really that bad, like people want to remove them? Why? We solve problems (and end up creating more, but the original problem is indeed solved) But no one can take the task as happily (or readily)as developers because we are driven by the hunger of understanding, the curiousity that kindles and fires the rest of the way through the solution, no one can easily outsource it.
