# TIL: TMUX Scroll mode select and copy

**Link:** https://www.meetgor.com/til/tmux-scroll-mode-select-and-copy/

## Context

I was in dilemma, I sometimes use Ghostty or default terminal, sometimes with multiple windows, sometimes different tabs, sometimes zellij and sometimes tmux.
          - I just forced myself to use TMUX and ended on the problems or flows that I have been avoiding to fix,failing to find and navigate around like a wizard, but took a few minutes to get the mess out, and here we go.
          - This was just a few key strokes away namely, `prefix + [ `to enter the scroll mode, Ctrl + Space to enter selection mode, and Enter or Ctrl + J to copy to clipboard. Rock and rolling with log driven debugging.
