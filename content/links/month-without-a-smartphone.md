## Context

* [**Month Without a Smartphone**](https://collabfund.com/blog/my-month-without-a-smartphone)**:** I could feel myself, but in place of his son, I depicted my mother scolding me to put the phone down. I mean there is nothing urgent or important on the phone, but feels like I am going to miss something important at any hour. This habit needs to be taken care of by me.
