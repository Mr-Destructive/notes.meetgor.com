# Appwrite Functions in Python

**Link:** https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/develop

## Context

[Appwrite Functions in Python](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/develop): As I have said, I have been experimenting with the Appwrite function ecosystem throughout the week on the side. I was basically trying to use Python functions for some prototyping ideas. I must say the documentation is really good. I learnt how to parse binary data into a response, a structure for a sample Python function, and set an appwrite json locally for functions.
