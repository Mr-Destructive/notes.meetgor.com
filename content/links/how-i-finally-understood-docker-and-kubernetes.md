# How I finally understood Docker and Kubernetes

**Link:** https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-i-finally-understood-docker-and-kubernetes-5debb13cacfe

## Context

This was my pick of the week. I understood the reason why Kubernetes exists
    - I knew the concept of Docker (it could be because I have used it extensively in the past to create projects as well in my internships to deploy APIs and apps)
    - But the concept of Kubernetes is like a black-box. But the author’s explanation style and simple example made it clear.
    - Kubernetes is like
          - Container Image > Deployment > Pod > Service
    - Container Image is the actual image of your app that you want to run, maybe it has multiple of those.
    - Deployment is like defining what and how many (other things too) to run.
    - Pod is like the actual unit of containers; in itself, it has no control, it just runs whatever was given to it.
    - Service is like the layer that exposes it to the world, maybe the network, the other containers, which are like a configurable exposure of the network.
