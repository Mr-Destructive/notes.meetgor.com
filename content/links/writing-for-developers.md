## Context

* [Writing for developers](https://rmoff.net/2023/07/19/blog-writing-for-developers/):  
    This is really a good read, writing brings clarity and clarity is what shapes you to pick up correct directions while developing anything. All the time, I start to write an article, I ran off a tangent on one or the other interesting thing that I had no idea about and assumed I knew it.
