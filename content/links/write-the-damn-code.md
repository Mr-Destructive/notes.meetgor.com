# Write the damn code

**Link:** https://antonz.org/write-code/

## Context

I am just 101% on this. I want myself to start the code, the dopamine hit, the shit show. But AI is there to help, don’t use it as a one-shot thing to create a software wand, it is a great peer, a great co-pilot, you still need to know what you are doing.
    - Vibe coding is basically delaying the shooting yourself on the foot problem.
    - Get involved and get into the zone.
