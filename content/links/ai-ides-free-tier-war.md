## Context

- [AI IDEs Free Tier War](https://ainativedev.io/news/ide-free-tier-war-windsurf)
    - Windsurf is surprisingly cheap, but they don’t have access to models like Claude 4 and others.
    - GPT 4.1 is good and all, but that’s a little supbar with the standard of Claude
    - I don’t know if that’s just me or I feel confident in copy-pasting a file from claude than from GPT
