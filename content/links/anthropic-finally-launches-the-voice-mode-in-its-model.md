# Anthropic finally launches the voice mode in its model

**Link:** https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11101966-using-voice-mode-on-claude-mobile-apps

## Context

Finally anthropic is adding voice mode. I love the way that anthropic comes at everything from behind and takes everything at it head, hopefully here will be the same.
    - The code part, the thinking part, the editing part of code is so reliable in Claude, however the search part I am not sure of.
