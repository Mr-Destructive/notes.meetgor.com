# How Serverless is killing the traditional backend role

## Context

- [How Serverless is killing the traditional backend role](https://dev.to/holasoymalva/how-serverless-is-killing-the-traditional-backend-role-2ff2): I agree with this, the backend developer role is shifting towards DevOps and Operations oriented tasks rather than writing from scratch things. This will rapidly evolve in my opinion with LLMs writing the code and at some point, the backend will just be a black box that is hardly touched with code, just a few knobs and switches to make changes.
