# What even is Vibe coding

## Context

- [What even is Vibe coding](https://ashley.dev/posts/what-even-is-vibe-coding/)
    - I completely agree with the entire post, this is the best take on vibe coding. I have experienced this and also mentioned it in my [post](https://meetgor.bearblog.dev/developers-side-project-graveyard-with-llms/). AI can handle the boring part, so that the developer can focus on the important, the heart of the craft. Whatever AI creates before this needs to be seen with a grain of salt, i.e., needs testing and review, it’s not a real person writing code after all.
    - It’s more of a tool than a replacement. LLMs are not there yet, it’s far from reality and close to boilerplate or already solved problems, not innovation.
    - If AI is giving you the entire code, then it is likely that the idea that you have for the software is already kind of there, not entirely, but vaguely there. For real innovations in the software, you still would need a developer.
