# AI Coding Sucks

**Link:** https://youtu.be/rgiuaJbyUyU

## Context

: Prime Reacts Agreed. I have never used the .md files for AI Agents, it doesn’t listen to the main prompt. How can it listen and adhere to the other file prompts? People just make it look sophisticated, but it really doesn’t need it. The Tab completion and one line or word completion is good, even a great time saver, but generating large chunks of diffs, nope. Thank you. I still do it. The war against developers using AI and a developer hand chisling code, is true, you can’t compete.
