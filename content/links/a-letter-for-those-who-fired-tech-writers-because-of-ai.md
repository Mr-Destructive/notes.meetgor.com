preview_description: 'Hey you,

  Yes, you, who are thinking about not hiring a technical writer this year or, worse,
  erased one or more technical writing positions last year because of AI. You, who
  are buying into the promise of docs entirely authored by LLMs without expert oversight
  or guidance. You, who unloaded the weight of docs on your devs’ shoulders, as if
  it was a trivial chore.

  You are making a big mistake. But you can still undo the damage.'

## Context

True empathy is key Liability, everything becomes liability if outsourced. LLMs don’t have the taste, the care feeling of the users, the developers yet.
