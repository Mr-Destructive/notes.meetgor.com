# Just use SQL they say

**Link:** https://www.architecture-weekly.com/p/just-use-sql-they-say-or-on-how-accidental

## Context

Use tooling around it, there are SQLC tools for go and I think even for Python. It will help you write type safe boilerplate code in the native language as you write the SQL query. I think the author is right, but unaware of the tooling that exists around it.
