# NotebookLM launches Video overview mode for notebooks summaries

**Link:** https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-video-overviews-studio-upgrades/

## Context

This is a good feature, not great! I tried it and it’s decent, cuts in between, just text and arrows matched up like a presentation deck for the given problem. Not much value for a deeper dive, but really great to get a gist and overview.
    - I can see this being used for news aggregation or summarising things from a lots of similar sources.
