## Context

what a flashback, everything makes sense. Programming is not mechanical yet people tried hard to make solve for it as it was mechanical COBOL made syntax readable. CASE tools eliminated typing. Visual tools eliminated syntax. AI can now generate entire functions from descriptions Each advancement addressed a real friction point.
