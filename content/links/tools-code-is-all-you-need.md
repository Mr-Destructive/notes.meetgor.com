# Tools: Code is all you need

## Context

1. [Tools: Code is all you need](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/3/tools/)
    - MCP is not worth the context I think, and this proves it. I have no experience but just from the understanding it would make sense, since a lot of things need to be made clear before using them right?
    - Imagine a human navigating this, you will have to make him aware that these are the tools, explain what each tool does and then provide them. But not to a professional, so we can conclude that LLMs are not professionals yet!
    - MCP is a bit verbose and might not be right for all kinds of models with less context window or limited capabilities.
