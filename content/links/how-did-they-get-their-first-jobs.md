## Context

- [How did they get their first Jobs](https://youtu.be/_CwpzZ8AVio?si=6VdVOSjgznwXiqUM)
    - Teej had some serious advice, having cover letters, showing that you care is so valuable. I have started to do that (oops, I am looking for a job actively, trying to get a switch after a year and half at my current company)
    - Prime had a good take, it just happened to him after he had worked and seriously worked hard enough. He was just doing his best and suddenly luck gave him a chance and he took it with both hands.
    - The other person, forgot the name. Also had a symphatical journey.
