    This was an interesting one, the power of the `SPLIT` function in python really should be the title of this video, just kidding. But the approach is what makes me wonder if that’s the way programming languages are created, really.  
    That is a bit obnoxious to think in that way, it will become quite a mess after a while (I am not talking about his code but just the approach). I thaught it would be like the theory of computing of state machines right?
