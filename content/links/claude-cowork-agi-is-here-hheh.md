# Claude Cowork: AGI is here, hheh?

**Link:** https://youtu.be/IcQEaopx90g

## Context

I loved the video. It showed the flaws and the possibilities of this tool. I think its a step in the AGI, but good or bad, the people will decide. The edit button on twitter, that had me rolling out loud. It was a human-esque reply though. “I can see the edit button therefore I am logged in as ABC person” True. Good thinking Claude. Hope you continue in a limited set of thinking.
