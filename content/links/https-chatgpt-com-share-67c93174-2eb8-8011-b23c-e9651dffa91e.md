## Context

- Also the interpreter mode can be used to provide a data source file and allow it to compute a few things to cross-validate with our code, this really saved me hours of debugging and quickly point out the issues, here is one conversation where the numbers were slightly off from my code and it helped me figure out that that was actually an issue in the data source and not in my code.
