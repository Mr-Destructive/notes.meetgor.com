## Context

This is a great series, I am reading more about it this weekend. LLMs are things that produce logits, which is like a list of probabilities from a vocabulary and for each token the highest probability token should have been chosen, however it is random the temperature determines how random the selection is, 0 means choose the first(highest probable, no creativeness), 1 means choose any random one. Between these 0 and 1 you can experiment to find the sweet spot for your needs.
