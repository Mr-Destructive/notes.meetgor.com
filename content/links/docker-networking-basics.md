## Context

[Docker Networking Basics](https://adventofdocker.com/posts/day-10-docker-networking/): Learning about docker is never enough, I learned about the -P which will forward all ports from the container to the host machine at random. That is wired but a good quirk to know, you never know when that might be handy.
