## Context

Last weekend, I wrote 4k words in a single day in around 3 hours. I was pumped to get all in the coming week, but only managed to get 2k words in the 5 days of the week. Struggling with consistency but trying to get hang of it. I am planning to wipe the story off this weekend, a 3-4 hour session could do it. And another goal of the year completed. I can't be more happy. A novel, first draft at the end of 2025.
