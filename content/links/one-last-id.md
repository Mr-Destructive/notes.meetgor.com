preview_description: 'Chris''s company has an unusual deployment. They had a MySQL
  database hosted on Cloud Provider A. They hired a web development company, which
  wanted to host their website on Cloud Provider B. Someone said, "Yeah, this makes
  sense," and wrote the web dev company a sizable check. They app was built, tested,
  and released, and everyone was happy.

  Everyone was happy until the first bills came in. They expected the data load for
  the entire month to be in the gigabytes range, based on their userbase and expected
  workloads. But for some reason, the data transfer was many terabytes, blowing up
  their operational budget for the year in a single month.
