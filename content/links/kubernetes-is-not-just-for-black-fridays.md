## Context

3. [Kubernetes is not just for Black Fridays](https://ergaster.org/posts/2025/07/09-kubernetes-black-friday/)
    1. I mean this is correct, I don’t want to deny this. Having a dependable system that scales is a good thing, instead of hacking a script or a pipeline for deployment or CI, creating a heavy yet robust system is worth it.
    2. However, the only counterpoint I have is how you learn the things that the larger system does without using each component at its core.
