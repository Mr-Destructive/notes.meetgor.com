## Context

Wow! What a banger of a post, what gold pieces of adivce
      > we cannot get rid of stress. What we can do is change our philosophy and the way we see things.
    - This blog advocates to meditate 10 minutes a day, it helps maybe. I need to try. But that comes after doing something, you act first, then if the result is not coming, you get anxious and frustrated if it failed, in that case, you need to calm down, you did whatever you could, but now you need to wait for it to resolve or learn from the failures.
    - Getting anxiety from the current problems is true, I cannot keep my mind away. I need to breathe and let it go, will try over the weekend and continue if it makes me happier.
