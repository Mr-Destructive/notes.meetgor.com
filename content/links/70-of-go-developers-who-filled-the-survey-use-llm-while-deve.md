## Context

- [70% of go developers (who filled the survey) use LLM while developing with Go](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3630940/go-teams-struggle-with-coding-standards-survey.html)
  That is an insane number, are you saying to me every 7 people out of 10 use LLM while working with Go? That is understandable considering how repeatable Golang gets sometimes, but the adoption rate is bonkers.

Not much news, I mean who will release a product on 31st December, developers are partying, right?
