# How OpenAI Atlas is built

**Link:** https://youtu.be/jxsA_185lMI?si

## Context

Atlas is a chromium wrapper right? right? Nope, its a little custom separate entity that is powered and laid by chromium but it doesn’t look and feel like Chromium. I don’t know anything about what Theo said, but if he is saying its gross. It might as well be, I can’t comment if I don’t know it.
