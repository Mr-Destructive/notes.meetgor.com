## Context

It appeared to me at the right time though, November in middle of NanoWriMo. Perfectly adding up to my writing streak and building confidence. [Building a terminal wizard in BubbleTea](https://youtu.be/Gl31diSVP8M)- This is a great video to understand Bubble Tea framework in almost 20 minutes. I was pumped after this to finally decide to build the TUI for GCP logger. Finally it will be done this weekend. [How OpenAI Atlas is built](https://youtu.be/jxsA_185lMI?si)- Atlas is a chromium wrapper right? right? Nope, its a little custom separate entity that is powered and laid by chromium but it doesn’t look and feel like Chromium.
