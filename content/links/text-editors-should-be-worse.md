# Text editors should be worse

## Context

Ok! I agree and disagree. You need to have a zen mode in your editor, which just is bare bones, and one for full fledged stuff like LSP, AI-auto-complete, syntax highlighting and what not. Editor is just a tool, it can’t code on its own(in 2025, still needs prompting), similarly to use it, it needs preferences.
