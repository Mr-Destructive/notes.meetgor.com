## Context

4. [Text editors should be worse](https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/annoying-text-editors.html)
    1. Ok! I agree and disagree. You need to have a zen mode in your editor, which just is bare bones, and one for full fledged stuff like LSP, AI-auto-complete, syntax highlighting and what not.
    2. Editor is just a tool, it can’t code on its own(in 2025, still needs prompting), similarly to use it, it needs preferences.
