# Crafting Interpreters: Introduction

**Link:** https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html

## Context

[Crafting Interpreters: Introduction](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html):  As said in the above blog, I am reading this book blog to get some overview of the working of interpreters. I have created a parser for markdown to substack json and vice versa, that is some Python shenanigans. But want to make it a proper parser and interpreter-like tool.
