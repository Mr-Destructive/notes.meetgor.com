## Context

- [My writing process, and how I keep it sustainable](https://ntietz.com/blog/my-writing-process-and-how-i-keep-it-sustainable/):   
  I am inspired by this article, the author claims to write everything in one go (not everything but the meat of the post) that is true for me. I just flush out my thoughts in one sitting too, however, my editing process is haywire, and haphazard. I usually don’t revise, I am not a professional technical writer, but when I do I do editing as they come.
