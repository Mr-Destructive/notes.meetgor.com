# Git Integrations is ten years away

**Link:** https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/12/29/git-integration-is-ten-years-away/

## Context

This is hillariously funny. I can’t imagine VS Code team coping up with git integrations in 2025 I don’t blame them entirely, at least they realize it is missing. With these LLM assisted coding, they decided to ship it finally. We have one instance of AI assisted coding helping VS Code ship faster (after 10 years). Learn Git, true. I alway 100% of the times use the cli. NO aliases, no agents, just CLI commands. git add, commit -m, push, pull, merge, rebase whatever. If I don’t know, I google it, read the ai overview and straight to the keyboards.
