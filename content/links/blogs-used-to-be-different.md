# Blogs used to be different

## Context

6. [Blogs used to be different](https://jetgirl.art/blogs-used-to-be-very-different/)
    - This is so well written, the conversations have been lost, it feels all clickbait and flow where the trend takes me, instead of the flow or my curiosity.
    - Blogging in earlier days, I am speaking from 2018-2020, I knew it used to be very much tied to google, I never read a lot of blog post at that time, so I can’t comment, but can feel the lack of social media would make it really amazing back then.
