# The time elemet that should actually do something

**Link:** https://nolanlawson.com/2025/12/14/the-time-element-should-actually-do-something/

## Context

Another div without a functionality problem. People create standards and forget to adhere. We have so many protocols, people and developers follow them, but there could be places where no one’s actually paid any attention. I am surprised there is no element to depict a time for an search engine to rely on, it relies on external factors like datepublished and other in the schema, wired. Even Google doesn’t care about this tag! Pathetic.
