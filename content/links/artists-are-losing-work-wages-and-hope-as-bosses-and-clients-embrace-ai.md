# Artists are losing work, wages, and hope as bosses and clients embrace AI

## Context

This is a serious topic, I have stopped using AI to generate thumbnails for my posts and whatever artistic form I used. Firstly it looks and feels dull and un-energetic. I do respect artists, this might be a disrespect for them to use their knowledge and wisdom without giving them a credit. I feel bad about the writers whose style and wisdom is now in-grained in models like GPT, Llama and Claude and others too.
