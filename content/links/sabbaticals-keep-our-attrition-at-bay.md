# Sabbaticals keep our attrition at bay

**Link:** https://world.hey.com/dhh/sabbaticals-keep-our-attrition-at-bay-9ccba5c0

## Context

A six week, almost one and a half month break, that is a huge one. I don’t like breaks, maybe it might be necessary in some point of time in someones life, the situation might demand it. But just because you have the option, I don’t like taking it. I think forcing yourself to work brings you the skill of consistency and trust.
