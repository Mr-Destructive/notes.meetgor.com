# No docs, no bugs

**Link:** https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/no-docs-no-bugs/

## Context

This is silly; the more detail you put, the more detailed your tests have to be
    - The more tests there are, the probability of all of them passing would start decreasing, and hence, it could cause subtle bugs
    - So I think it is a matter of convincing yourself to write more tests and documentation
