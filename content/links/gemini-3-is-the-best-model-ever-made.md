# Gemini 3 is the best model ever made?

**Link:** https://youtu.be/39PdgOYjBMg

## Context

Its a good model, it seems its quite heavy and removes the subtle mistakes and biases it has. I love hove Google makes a solid general purpose models. Unlike OpenAI, whose naming conventions are all over the place, its like a slop generation to me. But Gemini models hit different, they just solve what have been given to them. Quite a good upgrade from the 2.5 models. Waiting for Gemini 3 flash version
