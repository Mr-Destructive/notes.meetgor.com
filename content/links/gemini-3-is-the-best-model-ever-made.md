## Context

[The probelm with AI Slop](https://youtu.be/vrTrOCQZoQE)- I am also quite happy, if we use LLMs to train on their own generated data, it will be a stangnation. Artists are going to thrive here, but that’s too dumb of a mistake these AI companies are to make. They can take all possible measures to make the people make use these chatbots more and more.

[Gemini 3 is the best model ever made?](https://youtu.be/39PdgOYjBMg)- Its a good model, it seems its quite heavy and removes the subtle mistakes and biases it has. I love hove Google makes a solid general purpose models. Unlike OpenAI, whose naming conventions are all over the place, its like a slop generation to me.
