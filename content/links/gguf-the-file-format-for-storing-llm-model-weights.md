**Link:** https://vickiboykis.com/2024/02/28/gguf-the-long-way-around/

## Context

* [GGUF is the file format for storing LLM model weights](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/02/28/gguf-the-long-way-around/)
    
    * I wanted to evaluate an idea for a project. Running models from a file, and this file format is what I needed. Using this format and a binding with llama.cpp and other libraries, this can be used for inference later to actually run the model
