# On not using Django

**Link:** https://www.natemeyvis.com/on-not-using-django-in-2026/

## Context

I don’t quite get it. Maybe its true. Django provided a good start but then it was like a lock in. With LLMs its quite easy to generate the boilerplatey code that django provides out of the box, so that demand is lost? Its not the only reason django is here right? It has extensions, best python community and even more best documentation. I think it will be the best framework to build with LLMs in the future if the ecosystem continues to improve
