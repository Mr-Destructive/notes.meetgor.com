## Context

- [Why is everyone trying to replace software engineers](https://toddle.dev/blog/why-is-everyone-trying-to-replace-software-engineers): I had my first meeting where there were clients, actual users of the product. And I was a technical guy so not much needed for me to talk just demo the things, went a bit technical and in a jiffy but thats it, I think we will be replaced with the people who can understand the business better and not by any LLM. True.
