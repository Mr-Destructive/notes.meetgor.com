## Context

[Understanding B Trees: The data structure behind databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1a2Bk8NrYQ)
    - This was super cool, the way it was visualized and taught.
    - I adore Brain Yu, he is a master teacher. I learnt Python and Django from him.
    - B-trees are basically trees with an equal number of leaf nodes. No unbalanced roots. The operations to make the insertion and deletion made it really awesome for understanding.

- [Agentic Coding: The future of software development with agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfOVgz_omlU)
    - See, again, Claude's code and agentic tools are getting adorned by experienced developers too. This is the thing that makes me concerned about my own opinion and thoughts.
    - It surely is powerful but it hasn’t clicked for me yet I think.
