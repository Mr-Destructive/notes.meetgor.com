# Why building my blog is more fun than filling it

**Link:** https://clojurecivitas.github.io/civitas/why/i_should_write_more.html

## Context

Its a rabbit hole. I have done it and seen people do it too. Waylon Walker's Markata (its a python plugin based ssg, so easy to extend and setup) and my static site generator (I am calling it burrow, inspired as a home for golang gophers). I used jekyll > markata and felt the calling for writing my own ssg and here I am.
    - It feels rewarding to show the world what you have built for yourself and brag about it when someone sees it. It's like a garden, what is writing equivalent in gardening? Planting trees, that's how the blog gets populated, and adding different things to the garden is what is addictive and feels like a gardener.
