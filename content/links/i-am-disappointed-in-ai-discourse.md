# I am disappointed in AI discourse

## Context

Wow, at least someone feels like me. This was so relatable to read on a Sunday afternoon.
    - This feels relatable to feel like how can people draw conclusions and biases when the technology is evolving everyday.
    - People are either fully bullish on AI, i.e. by 2026, no developers needed, to some saying AI is still crap. Both of them don’t know what AI is capable yet. It is not that bad, compared to a year ago, it’s really good at generating almost accurate code, but not quite the touch that it can be untouched without a developer glancing and ficing it.
