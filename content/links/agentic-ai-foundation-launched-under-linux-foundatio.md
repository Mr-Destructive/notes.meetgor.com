## Context

- [**Agentic AI Foundation Launched Under Linux Foundatio**](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation)**n**
    - Wow! Anthropic in opensource, who would have thought.
    - Anthropic donated MCP, OpenAI with Agents.md (I am actually confused, what is a agent and file name belonging to a company, why they own it?), Goose from Block.

That’s it from the week. I am excited to code more in parallel, by spawning the agents in the background and reviewing the code. Yes, I no more write code by hand. I like to when I do, but as a software developer and employee, I don’t write code as I used to a year back. I spawn code agents and heavily review its output. Embrace the way it is, adapt the skills, there’s no other way.
