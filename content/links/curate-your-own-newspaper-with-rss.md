## Context

7. [Curate your own newspaper with RSS](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/)
    1. In this constant hole of doomscrolling which I think I was falling for the last couple of weeks and finally got out by reading books. fiction books. It is important to make these kinds of apps and rss readers, as to be mindful about what we consume and at what rate.
    2. In those days (2014-2017), I used to read newspaper after coming home from school. Those were just a 10 minute glance at the first 2 pages, but majority of time was spent in the sport and science zone. I loved reading it, that now makes me wonder, that even little and moderated content is enough for the brain to sustain. This never ending social media has made us brain want more and more, so we need to bring that fun and content (satisfaction) in content back.
