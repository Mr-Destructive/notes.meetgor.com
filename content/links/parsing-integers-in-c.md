# Parsing integers in C

**Link:** https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/11/13/parsing-integers-in-c/

## Context

Its again one relatable post. The author is pointing out that he saw a problem. Parsing and robust handling of integers in C. I love python for it. I wonder how is it developed on top of C then. If C is worse than python for handing integers, how is Python working so well. cURL, that library man! The author and the creator of libcURL or cURL the tool is a legend, he is a gift to the developers and the world. The library is much more than a http client. It has laid so many ground works for making the ecosystem of working with the web and APIs coherently and without causing any confusions. This post highlights the presence of parser for string to integer conversion in cURL as well as cURLX libraries. It handles them in a more robust way than the typical standard C libraries.
