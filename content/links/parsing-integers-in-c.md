## Context

I don’t have much to say, a lot to say rather. I recommend just reading it, it gave me calmness, it’ll be just fine. AI is not coming to burn you, don’t worry, but there will be a new resource at our disposal. You know it, it has its pros and cons, the AI chat. [Parsing integers in C](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/11/13/parsing-integers-in-c/)- Its again one relatable post. The author is pointing out that he saw a problem. Parsing and robust handling of integers in C. I love python for it. I wonder how is it developed on top of C then. If C is worse than python for handing integers, how is Python working so well.
