## Context

- [AI-assisted search](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search)
    - AI-assisted search is really revolutionizing the google search, its a tool call at the end of the day, but the way it is executed and prompted is really an art.
    - Gemini seems to be rocking at this. It was obvious that Google who has been ruling the search for the past 2 decades, will rule the next search too, but Open-AI and Preplexity had led the revolution. Just like Mozilla had it for browsers, then Chrome tookover.
