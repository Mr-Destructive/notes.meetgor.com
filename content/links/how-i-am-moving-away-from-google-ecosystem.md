## Context

- [How I am moving away from Google Ecosystem](https://itsfoss.com/leaving-google-ecosystem/?ref=dailydev): This is quite straightforward post, I see a lot of things missing like f-droid instead of Play Store, but it was quite helpful. I don’t use Mail that extensively and I think Gmail is not a bad thing. Others are good too, not sure of their privacy reasons.
