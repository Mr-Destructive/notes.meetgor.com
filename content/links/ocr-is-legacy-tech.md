## Context

- [OCR is Legacy tech](https://www.cloudsquid.io/blog/ocr-is-legacy-tech)
    - Maybe it is, but not completely. There will be need of low cost easy document extractions. Yes, if the cost factor goes down, OCR would be obsolete.
    - I work in these domain, and can say, a lot of things are changing quite rapidly, LLMs and VLLMs are taking the extraction industry by storm.
    - Its quite easy to one shot an extraction with VLLMs given the intricated details might be missed by OCR and with VLLMs, its like a brain powered visual detector. It really understands the context and its knowledge really comes in the clutch to parse almost any type of document.
    - Really excited to see where my journey leads in this development
