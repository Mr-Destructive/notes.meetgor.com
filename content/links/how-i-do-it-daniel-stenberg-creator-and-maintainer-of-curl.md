## Context

1. [How I do it - Daniel Stenberg(Creator and Maintainer of cURL)](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/13/how-i-do-it)
    1. Such an honest and encouraging post. It shows how a single curiosity, a fun project can become a livelihood for someone or many people.
    2. He has made his curiosity take direction and kindled it with consistency.
    3. He also without shame and guilt admits the truth about maintaining a project or even working at something for quite a few years or even half a decade. Commendable spirit.
      > First let’s not pretend that it *always* feels fun and thrilling. Sometimes it actually feels a bit boring and *done. *There is no shame in that and it is not strange or odd. Such periods come and go. When they come, I might do less curl for a while. Or maybe find a corner of the project that is not important but could be fun to poke at. I have learned that these periods come and go.
