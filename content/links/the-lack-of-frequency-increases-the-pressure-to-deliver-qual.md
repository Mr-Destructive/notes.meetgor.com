# The lack of frequency increases the pressure to deliver quality

**Link:** https://rachsmith.com/a-lack-of-frequency/

## Context

Consistency is really helpful in writing or any action.
    - I used to write 100 days of golang 2-3 times a month initially, but lost the consistency due to college and internship tasks, and then spiralled into me not being confident and pressured on the quality aspect, ,procrastination and fear seeping in.
