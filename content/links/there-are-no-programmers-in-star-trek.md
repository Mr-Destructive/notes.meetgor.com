# There are no programmers in Star Trek

## Context

This makes me sad, if there are no real programmers, how are their services operating? If computers just work and do what they are told, why is there even a service? Why just not complete everything and be done with it? I wonder if 2027 be a year like that, where you say something and vibe coded mess some how works, how far are we from the reality to here?
