# Firebase Studio

**Link:** https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio

## Context

[Qwen-3 Coder](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/): It seems we have now a whole bunch of terminal based ai code war. Claude Code, Codex (does anyone use it?), Warp, Ampcode, Gemini CLI, now Qwen.
- [GitHub releases Spark for public preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-23-github-spark-in-public-preview-for-copilot-pro-subscribers/): This looks solid and well engineered product, will be trying out this weekend, finger crossed, will get time and will be streaming it.

I’ll leave you here, it’s been a great week atleast on the learning side, should be more fun next week and over the weekend.
