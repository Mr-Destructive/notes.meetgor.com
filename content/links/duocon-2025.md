# Duocon 2025:

**Link:** https://duocon.duolingo.com/

## Context

- [Duocon 2025:](https://duocon.duolingo.com/)
    - This is an App I am admiring for its UI and UX, so clean and intuitive
    - Addictive design is a different thing, but its utility and worth using
    - I was awaiting the [Chess feature since May](https://blog.duolingo.com/chess-course/) and it finally launched this week. Can’t wait to up my chess skills

That was a heck of a long week. Lot of tech things happening. It will get even more in the next couple of months, as it is October and there are already a lot of developer related things, conferences, hactoberfests, and among other things.
