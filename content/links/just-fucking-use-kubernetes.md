# Just fucking use Kubernetes

**Link:** https://waylonwalker.com/just-fucking-use-kubernetes/

## Context

This article is true and motivating to learn Kubernetes
    - I read an article which was the opposite of this, not in a bad way, just a way of presenting the idea to keep it simple and avoid the complexity if not needed.
    - This article, however, is a motivator in a couple of sense, first it says if you think the scale is low, your ambitions are low. What a statement.
    - And also it’s an under kill if you think Kubernetes is an overkill
    - Nice AI-generated slop, actually is good.
