## Context

- [Gemini 2.0 is Generally available](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/): I have read this a much more better and cheaper model then it’s competitors. But the only reason I am afraid of its adoption is google’s ability to throw it in the graveyard. I have seen bard go that route as well, so I no more trust Google on the product’s reliability.
