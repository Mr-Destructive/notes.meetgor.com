# I just want to code

**Link:** https://www.zachbellay.com/daily/i-just-want-to-code/?ref=dailydev

## Context

I honestly feel this way, the war between your heart and mind.
    - What a coincidence, I am on a war, turns out, everyone is too. Everyone is fighting the control of the mind over the heart, the ego over the soul.
    - The author of this post has really put it well, just read that post, instead of this rambling.
