# Mostly Technical: Hearts and Minds

## Context

Boy I have some thoughts here. Aaron’s AI Stack > Claude Opus 4.5, Amp Code, Code Rabbit for review Ship code, no one cares how its done Have an idea > research > plan > throw it to AI > look at it, stare at it > ship it What is the perfect abstraction, no, what can I get shipped. I like to code, but I loved implementing ideas, now its easier to code with AI, it knows the patterns and abstractions. You have to eyeball the code slop it generates. AI to check in AI, I was too not sure of, but lately the Seer bot from Sentry is so cool, it picks up grave stuff. You need the human, flavour is the juice. People can produce code, but not software, you have to have a point of view I have more then ever to build, the need of software engineers is going to get more. Maybe, I don’t know. They would need a person who can steer them. Its a great time to study systems, and not specific frameworks. Argh I hate to say that, but I disagree here. We need to know the tools, not specificity but still, humans are nerdy people they can’t live without doing or learning something, even if that is pointless. Learning Systems, true, I agree wholeheartedly to that. Maybe he means in the terms of content creation. People are not going to watch or read such specific guides to tech framework and tools, but broader skills than technical details. But I still think having the knowledge of specific tech or tool will give you the edge over the one slopping and producing slop when the time comes. Human’s shared experience is something I am starting to consume more. Or rather consuming just that. No one likes AI slop, look at hackernews, people are reading experiences of x person using y ai tool to get things done. The point of Aaron on shared experience on Pride and Prejudice written by human, is something people are still consuming and talking about after a decade or more. But what about PaLM? Do you remember the model? Noooo. We need human connection. The idea train from Ian is contagious, I am running it something on my brain to think of something to make in SQL or some code.
