## Context

* [Taming the beast: Django ORM](https://www.davidhang.com/blog/2024-09-01-taming-the-django-orm/?ref=dailydev): Django is a beast when it comes to ORM, but I have started getting back from Django, as I don’t get to go a bit low-level, I can’t write raw SQL. But I am grateful and really happy that I started with Django, it helped me land my first internship and help me understand the terms in the tech. This was the major reason I started blogging and haven’t stopped since then. I went off on a tangent here, but Django ORM is great if you want to do something sophisticated with the data structures that would have in the database.
