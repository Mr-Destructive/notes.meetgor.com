# DuckDB in 100 seconds: Fireship is back?

**Link:** https://youtu.be/uHm6FEb2Re4

## Context

In 2025, we haven’t seen any 100 seconds video from Fireship, is this some sort of a cope to AI slop or really we think he was in crisis.
    - But anyways, duckdb is cool, I haven’t tried it, it does use column based instead of tables or rows, which is kind of cool.
