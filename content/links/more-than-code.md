# More than Code

**Link:** https://deadprogrammersociety.com/2025/07/more-than-code.html

## Context

Reading code in the age of AI, is gold and the only thing I think people spend most of the time, with other being vibe-debugging which might be fair less then vibe-reading.
    - Reading code should become like instinct, just by gazing, you should be able to smell bad code and sniff the bugs out. This is not easy, it comes with practise and years of slog-debugging, first debugging the human code then go to vibe-debugging.
