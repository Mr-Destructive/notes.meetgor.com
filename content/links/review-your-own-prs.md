# Review your own PRs

## Context

This is good advice, I do it as a ritual on GitHub, 8 out of 10 times, I get the feedback myself. The editor myth is real, there are things that you don’t notice in your editor, in your environment, in your flow. But as soon as the context changes, the words, and the logic seem to be distant. Believe this advice, this saves a ton of time.
