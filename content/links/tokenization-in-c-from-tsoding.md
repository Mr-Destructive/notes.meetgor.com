# Tokenization in C from Tsoding

**Link:** https://youtu.be/6dCqR9p0yWY

## Context

This was another great livestream like tutorial. The depth with which he communicated and came up with the solution is what helped me get better understanding of tokenization. This is an example, why learning from first fundamentals is still cool. The ability to learn and explain with confidence and comfort is remarkable quality for a developer. This is also I am still thinking about doing livestream and being able to develop something from scratch.
