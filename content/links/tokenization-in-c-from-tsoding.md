## Context

This was another great livestream like tutorial. The depth with which he communicated and came up with the solution is what helped me get better understanding of tokenization.
    - This is an example, why learning from first fundamentals is still cool. The ability to learn and explain with confidence and comfort is remarkable quality for a developer. This is also I am still thinking about doing livestream and being able to develop something from scratch.
