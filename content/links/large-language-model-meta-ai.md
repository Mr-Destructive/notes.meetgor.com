# Large Language Model Meta AI

## Context

A wired random prompt that surprisingly is not random: [Tweet](https://x.com/MeetGor21/status/1935636326243549328)
    - This is not 100% reproducible but quite the gist of it is similar
    - Pick a number between 1 and 100
          - ChatGPT, LLaMA, Claude, Mistral gives 27
          - Grok AI gives 42
    - Pick a random letter between a and z
          - ChatGPT, Mistral gives M or K
          - Grok AI, LLaMA gives K
    - This is a wired behaviour from LLMs, and it also makes sense since it will try to mimic what it has seen most of the times in its training process.
- Render is the new Heroku for free application deployment
    - I used it to deploy my FastAPI backend for BYOK AI Chat App.
    - Its similar to the old Heroku hobby tier plan, which was vindicated in 2022.
    - I am not sure how reliable these Platform-As-A-Service are anymore after the Heroku sunset of hobby plan, but nonetheless its what we get from a free tier and its worth appreciating such companies are providing free tiers.
    - I am wondering can Appwrite take over its spot, its more of a microservice oriented setup but still it has a lot of potential to compete in the space.
- [Copy and Paste Markdown in Google Docs](https://one-tip-a-week.beehiiv.com/p/one-tip-a-week-paste-markdown-and-copy-to-markdown-in-google-docs)
    - This was a neat trick to learn, especially if you are writing for documentation and personal notes. Also handy if you want to quickly add something special without fluff in the doc. The keyboard centric approach helps in this markdown style.
