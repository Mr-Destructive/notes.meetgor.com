## Context

[Hot Take: **TILs are junk food**](https://antonz.org/til/?ref=dailydev) I don’t agree with this, but some extent this post is true. I don’t read tils, I only come upon TILs from the feed that are relevant to me, so I only follow people whom I share the same interests and tools being used. There is value in reading someone's else perspective about using and discovering the tools or any thing common.
