# Did Apple just give up on AI?

## Context

AI and Apple can’t be on the same boat at least in 2025, it seems.
    - Sad to see it, but they are truly behind in tech right now. Their hardware is good, but they have to grow significantly to stay even competitive.

Phew, what a week, nothing much in releases, but the cloudflare x google cloud outage just wrecked havoc in almost half IT companies. Many unicorns faced this downtime for a while. That’s a wild week till June 14th
