## Context

- [Did Apple just give up on AI?](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-supercharges-its-tools-and-technologies-for-developers)
    - AI and Apple can’t be on the same boat at least in 2025, it seems.
    - Sad to see it, but they are truly behind in tech right now. Their hardware is good, but they have to grow significantly to stay even competitive.

Phew, what a week, nothing much in releases, but the cloudflare x google cloud outage just wrecked havoc in almost half IT companies. Many unicorns faced this downtime for a while. That’s a wild week till June 14th
