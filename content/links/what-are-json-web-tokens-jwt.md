## Context

8. [What are JSON Web tokens (JWT)](https://blog.algomaster.io/p/json-web-tokens)
    - Find me a better JWT tutorial then this, I’ll wait.
    - Explained the problem then developed the intuition for the reason why JWTs exist. Very well explained, detailed and the diagram made it perfect for visualising the flow. It also mentioned the best practises, ticking all the boxes for a great article.
    - Must read for beginner getting to understand JWT Authentication after learning Session based authentication.
