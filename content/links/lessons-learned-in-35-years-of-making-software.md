## Context

[Lessons learned in 35 years of making Software](https://dev.jimgrey.net/2024/07/03/lessons-learned-in-35-years-of-making-software/): I have barely lived half of 35 years, the sheer amount of experience in 35 years of software is immense respect. But what is shared here, the words disheartened me that your code will eventually be deleted, will be replaced, will be evolved. This is a harsh reality but we need to accept and move ahead in life.
