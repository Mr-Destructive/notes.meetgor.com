## Context

This is the best of the lot. Nailed every point. Coding was never a bottleneck, communication was (is). Yes, it can do trivial task, but that is not 20% of developers work. Its still bad at complex stuff. Vibe coders hit a ceiling after a while. Reviewing is worse than writing it yourself. AI is a tool just like IDEs, you are not losing or missing out on it. When did learning deeper and low-level knowledge get uncool or not important? It hasn’t, its just hype, hiding form us the actual pillar behind the rise in information accessibility.
