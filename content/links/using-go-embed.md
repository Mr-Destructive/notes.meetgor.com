## Context

[Using Go Embed](https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/go-embed): This is really handy and I just used it while researching and creating the video for SQLC. This was really a handy trick and feature in Go, to inject some raw strings or content from files, for instance, it helps in injecting the raw SQL queries from files to the golang program and executes them programmatically. This is commonly used with static files and templating as well I guess.
