# Why I do programming

**Link:** https://esafev.com/notes/why-i-do-programming/

## Context

> For me, programming has always been more than a skill. It’s a way to explore, to tinker, and to satisfy curiosity.
    - This is what programming is about, using curiosity to find the solutions to the problems. Curiosity is like a fire that keeps you warm in the winter.
