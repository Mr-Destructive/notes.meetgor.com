# Claude Haiku 4.5: The best model from Anthropic for cost to intelligence figures

**Link:** https://youtu.be/iES9r7AZP1s

## Context

Maybe its a big leap in terms of intelligence to cost ratio. We might get more cheaper models with more intelligence. Open Models especially the China Models are pushing these AI Labs in a better direction. GLM and Kimi K2 have forced Anthropic to release this to stay competitive and able to sustain their growth. Phew! What times to live in as a developer.
