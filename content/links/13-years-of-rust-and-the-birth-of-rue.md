## Context

8. [13 Years of Rust and the birth of Rue](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/thirteen-years-of-rust-and-the-birth-of-rue/?ref=dailydev)
    1. I see this a lot! People creating something that they wanted but didn’t had the mental energy for.
    2. I see it as draining rather. I can’t watch it write code for me, its a dreading feeling to be in for larger durations.
