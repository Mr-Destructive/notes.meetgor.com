## Context

This is cool, I talked about it in my thoughts as Appwrite is kind of entering the full-stack as a service ecosystem with this launch
    - They came #1 on Product Hunt this weekDouble click to interact with video
- Datbricks bought Neon
    - This is a interesting buy
    - Data analysis with the powerhouse database ready for AI
    - Making a viable integration with the Neon database.
    - Great move by Databricks
    - Neon doesn’t have enterprise customers, they are low on funds. But they have a wide adoption and great AI integrations
    - Databricks has enterprise customers, but not much to offer on the AI side
    - Combine the,m and suddenly they both become a deadly combo
