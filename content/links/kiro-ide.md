## Context

- [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/): Amazon out of thin air just blew this up. Its almost like Cursor but with more controlled and flexible using preferences. It almost forces developers to plan and thoroughly consider the most tedious and boring part (sometimes the most exciting) of the development which is defining the problem and listing the features.
