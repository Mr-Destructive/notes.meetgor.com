# Mr. TIFF

## Context

- I stopped creating ai generated thumbnails on this newsletter after a couple of attempts as it felt boring. I didn’t get anything from that. No satisfaction nor skill.

[Mr. TIFF](https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/mr-tiff/)- It was just a pleasant read. No controversy, no fluff. Just two humble and honest humans doing their job. This world would be so beautiful if each human did its job correctly, just correctly, not exceeding the expectation or performing a all-nighter. Just completing his or her job correctly is so under-rated.
