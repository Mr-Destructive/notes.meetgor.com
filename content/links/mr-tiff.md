# Mr. TIFF

**Link:** https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/mr-tiff/

## Context

It was just a pleasant read. No controversy, no fluff. Just two humble and honest humans doing their job. This world would be so beautiful if each human did its job correctly, just correctly, not exceeding the expectation or performing a all-nighter. Just completing his or her job correctly is so under-rated.
