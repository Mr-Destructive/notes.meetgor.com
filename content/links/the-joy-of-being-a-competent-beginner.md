# The joy of being a competent beginner

**Link:** https://xydinesh.com/posts/joy-of-competent-beginner/

## Context

This is really well put. Very relatable. We all have started with some quick competence at something in the beginning and then ignored or abandon after some familiarity of it. This exactly lists why we do that, and the reason is that going beyond that beginner competence is a steep learning curve, initially you are fast but then quickly hit a wall. Most of them give up, the ones that stick, are the ones that somewhat develop a mastery or sort of craftsmanship in the art.
