# First User Framework

## Context

If there is no user, that is not a solution; it is a problem you are inventing yourself.
    - If you are developing something for yourself, don’t do it right away. If you have the time and capacity to keep up with the learning and work-life balance, then do it without thinking. But if you are already burnt out, maybe just don’t, it might lead you nowhere.
    - If you have one user, start building it. If you have at least a user, there is already a feedback loop developed once you build it. The instant feedback input and the validation part makes it addictive.
