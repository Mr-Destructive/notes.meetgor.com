## Context

It was so deep, like his thinking is so defensive and critical. Some of the points I found out to be contrasting. The start was promising but he started to shade his own points I believe. The math solving problems, which makes sense, but then evolution of human thinking, the built in parameters. The point of having intrinsic motivation is not mentioned in the conversation which makes me wonder, why it was not? It was such s distinguishing factor, but he doesn’t wants to distinguish humans, so why try to mimic humans?
