# Notes on switching to Helix from Vim

**Link:** https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/

## Context

1. [Notes on switching to Helix from Vim](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/)
    - I like this approach of adapting to tooling. The author had clearly listed the reason, the main crux of why he chose Helix over Vim in the first place.
    - I like that the language server is built in, just like PyCharm is for Python. VS Code, you have to install plugins or extensions. Vim as well you’ll have to configure LSPs and plugins. Helix is a good middle ground, I think.
    - No tool is perfect, and it obviously has some quirks and things that might not please everyone, you just have to get used to them.
