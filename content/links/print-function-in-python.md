# Print function in Python

**Link:** https://youtu.be/MuzF9oQb2rI

## Context

Wow! I thought print was for stdout, but it was meant to be written to the file. So cool. I though write was the only option to write the file, but this is so crucial to know. Print is a very versatile function. Sometimes, it makes me wonder, is python really a magical language.
