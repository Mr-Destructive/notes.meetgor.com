## Context

People have raised concerns that it might be because of AI, but that really makes GitHub in a position of bother. It might even get backlash and people might start finding alternatives.
- [Claude 4 Sonnet now supports 1 Million tokens of context](https://www.anthropic.com/news/1m-context)
    - This is huge jump, it was 200K token previously, making it a 5x more context.
- [Google releases Gemma 3 with 270 Million parameter](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3-270m/)
    - Such a small model and perfect for low end devices, but not sure about the performance to intelligence ration. Obviously it will be small, but if its faster and as neck to neck as llama 1 Billion then that makes it really the best one out there in this range of parameters.
