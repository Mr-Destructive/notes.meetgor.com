preview_description: "He has heard the whispers, â\x80\x9Che is getting older, who\
  \ will replace him?â\x80\x9D People asking him with a straight face, â\x80\x9Cwhen\
  \ will you retire?â\x80\x9D After close to 25 years at Amazon, where each year has\
  \ been different and amazing, He feels as young as the day he decided to leave academia\
  \ and join Amazon.\nThe thing about getting older as a developer, is that you have\
  \ seen a lot and encountered many of the problems younger developers are facing\
  \ (even if they look a little different on first glance). If youâ\x80\x99ve been\
  \ around the block as many times as some of us have, youâ\x80\x99ll have earned\
  \ battle scars along the way. There are days in war rooms you will never forget.\
  \ You have experimented a lot, and you have failed more times than you care to remember.\
  \ You have half-a-head full of what is practical and works. And a quarter of that\
  \ space has been trained to look for red flags, scanning for things that you know\
  \ will go wrong."

New tech, same patterns. And this one Have an in-depth conversation with your customer, listen, dive deep into their challenges, suggest architectures, migrations, and tools. And sometimes, the solution will be generative AI.
