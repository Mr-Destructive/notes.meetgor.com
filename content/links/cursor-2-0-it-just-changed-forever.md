## Context

[Cursor 2.0: It just changed forever](https://youtu.be/VgtfpTGJmHQ)- This is fast, blazingly fast. The model I don’t know but the speed is truly fast. If the intelligence is not degraded from gpt5, I think its a good option to have.

[Exposing Brain Rot AI](https://youtu.be/XhJYNSssqrA)- Brain rot. This is hillarious how reasoning, long context and short form content can alter. 

[AI Coding Sucks](https://youtu.be/rgiuaJbyUyU): Prime Reacts- Agreed. I have never used the .md files for AI Agents, it doesn’t listen to the main prompt. How can it listen and adhere to the other file prompts? People just make it look sophisticated, but it really doesn’t need it.
