# dc as a mathematical utility in linux

**Link:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_(computer_program)

## Context

dc or desk calculator, a very inappropriate name.
    - It is a calculator utility in linux. Its pretty basic and has only 20 odd commands, but it can do any maths operations. Apt very apt for a unix philosophy, do one thing very precisely and correctly.
- Reviewing AI generated code is no joke
    - I produced AI slop for a feature, or rather improvement feature.
    - It was so terrible or glazzing that I had to launch a v2. But then after 3 days spending my head banging at cursor chat window and letting it rip it off and analysing it with bare hands.
    - It took some time, but it had created something meaningful after all. Was it worth it, maybe. Would I have taken the same time? At the best case, yes, no maybe. But that is not the best part of LLM vibe coding.
    - It is about the rest of the stuff, the benchmarking, the rip off why things work, grilling it, questioning its own produced slop, against each other. Producing throwaway test and scripts to test its own garbage.
    - That is so quick, the feedback is almost instant feedback. I am genuinely blessed and grateful to have privileged to be in a company to be able to use such productive tools like Cursor, Gemini, and others.
- PDF Forensics
    - For creating the mentioned features, I had to dig deep, read a lot of slop to find the gems of actual features.
    - I discovered that we can detect suspicious pdfs with embedded files in metadata or the actual pdf content. We can even use certain techniques to detect overlaying text in the content of the pdf with the location.
