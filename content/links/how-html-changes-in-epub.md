# How HTML changes in EPUB

**Link:** https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/11/

## Context

This is quite intuitive. I didn’t knew epub is a collection of XHTML documents. Its quite obvious now. Because e-book has to be scaled from each character, so it is xhtml or some variant of it. Zooming, Changing fonts, all happens at all levels or doesn’t look good. So that is the perfect use case for it.
