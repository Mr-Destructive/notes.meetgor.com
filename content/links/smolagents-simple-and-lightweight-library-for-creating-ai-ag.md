# SmolAgents: Simple and Lightweight Library for creating AI Agents in Python

**Link:** https://youtu.be/d0xRi2OeFHw?si=tTHB6OETJlasBbQ3

## Context

I learned a lot, created a few examples
    
    * Basic tools: Multiply and add (call me silly, but LLMs can’t add)
        
    * Specific tools: Scrape a website and list all the links and content
        
    * Answering a user query from a DB
        
        * Generating the SQL query from Natural language
            
        * Executing the SQL query as a tool
            
    * Using Local LLMs (llama3.2:1b and Gemma3:1b)
        
    * Using Cloud LLMs (Mistral Small)
