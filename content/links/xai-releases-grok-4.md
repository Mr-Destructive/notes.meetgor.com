# XAI releases Grok 4

**Link:** https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/grok-4-0709

## Context

- [XAI releases Grok 4](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/grok-4-0709): The model is the smartest model to date, and also the most expensive. Interesting quirk is that, if you ask for its opinions, it dials up Elon Musk’s Tweets to find his opinion. Wired quirk but maybe *unintentional*
