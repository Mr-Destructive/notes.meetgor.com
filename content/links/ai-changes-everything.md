**Link:** https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/

## Context

- [AI changes everything](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/)
    - Everyone seems to be positive about AI, I am not against it, its good, but its moving too fast.
      > I encourage you not meet that moment with cynicism or fear: meet it with curiosity, responsibility and the conviction that this future will be bright and worth embracing.
