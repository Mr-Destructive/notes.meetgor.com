## Context

- [Google releases Gemma 3:](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-3/) Google released gemma 3 with 4 variation models of 1b, 4b, 12b, and 27b parameters. 4,12 and 27 are multi-modal supporting image parsing, have 128k context window, also support tool calling. I wrote some [notes on this](https://meetgor.substack.com/p/notes-on-gemma-3).

Phew, I did a good comeback after 2 weeks of complete slump. That was it for a bit busy week in tech. It has been quite a lot, models released as usual, transformative adoption of tools for agentic workflows.
