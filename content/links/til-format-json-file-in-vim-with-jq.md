# TIL: Format JSON file in Vim with JQ

**Link:** https://dev.meetgor.com/til/format-json-in-vim-with-jq/

## Context

I will be writing more since I have set up my blog at dev.meetgor.com, it is served by my own Static Site generator using Golang and Netlify Cloud Functions hosted on GitHub Pages. I still need a few things to sort out which will do on the live stream.

I created this SSG in Golang from scratch (except for  the markdown parsing) on live streams. This also has a CMS or an API that can add posts to the database and GitHub pages can sync up with the database and save the post to the GitHub repo.
