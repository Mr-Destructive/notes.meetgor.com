# Perplexity launches Comet browser

**Link:** https://comet.perplexity.ai/

## Context

As expected, there was a model release this week, if you have been following the trend, we are nearly getting a new model every two weeks. And for the past two weeks, there was no major model drop and this was anticipated. Next week Open AI might be cooking something.

That’s it from the week 50, we are close on the one year anniversary of this newsletter. Wow! a whole year has been gone in writing these newsletters, didn’t expect it to be that quick.
