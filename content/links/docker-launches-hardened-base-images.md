# Docker launches hardened base images

**Link:** https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-hardened-images/

## Context

7. [Docker launches hardened base images](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-hardened-images/)
    - DHI are the new thing in docker, they help in avoiding the image bloat.
    - They are not just trimmed-down versions of existing containers, they’re built from the ground up which is really interesting to work with and help optimise the build process as well as deployment constraints.

  > Docker Hardened Images start with a dramatically reduced attack surface, up to 95% smaller, to limit exposure from the outset.
