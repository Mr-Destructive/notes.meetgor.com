## Context

- [Revenge of the junior developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer)
    - Ok, I spent half an hour reading this article and felt a mix of opinions
    - On one side, I am happy that I am a junior, I am dabbling with AI agents and tab tab things, but it’s kind of weird to use them.
    - I don’t like the review part, it feels like a daunting task
