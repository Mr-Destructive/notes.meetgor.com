# David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) on Rails World 2025: Opening Note

## Context

I can’t fathom here, how did we end up backwards? It takes some thinking to deploy to prod, yaml manifests, and what not to deploy a simple API, how the heck people are accepting those? It is like a egoistic culture to have complexity and assume that it will work, but they are only adding complexity upon layers of complexity that developers will have to clean up themselves. Rails is doing a phenomenal job in the developer ecosystem.
