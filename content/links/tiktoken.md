# TikToken

**Link:** https://github.com/openai/tiktoken

## Context

* [TikToken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) the tokeniser that powers GPT and its family of models: I want to explore this and create a project around it. I learnt that is the model that actually determines the number of tokens passed around the chats while interacting with the LLMs.
