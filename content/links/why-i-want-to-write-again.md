# Why I want to write again

## Context

I also want to write again. It has been almost a year since I started this newsletter, and I have not been able to break into a habit of writing the blogs that I used to back then.
    - The author’s claims are so true, and I can’t agree more, but the habit is the key part that holds me back. There is never a smooth life; something or the other hinders the focus.
