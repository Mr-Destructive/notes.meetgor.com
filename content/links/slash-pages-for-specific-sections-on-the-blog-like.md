# Slash pages for specific sections on the blog like

**Link:** https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com/post/494

## Context

[Slash pages for specific sections on the blog like](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com/post/494) - /now - /colophon - /links, etc I am about to create a thoughts/link blog page for my site. Moving my site out of an SSG is the new year norm I believe, I moved my site from Jekyll to Markata 2 years ago, and now it seems the correct time. I don’t have any problems with Markata, I just want to use Golang for all the things I make, it feels good (not biased). ## Tech News
