## Context

10. [How I code with AI on a low budget/free](https://wuu73.org/blog/aiguide1.html)
    1. I need to try Cline, claude code router and qwen models. I have been sleeping on local hosted models, nit entirely though. I have a low spec laptop, 8GB RAM, so can’t use a model beyond 2 or 4 Billion parameter.
    2. Kimi also has an API and a free credits, might as well give it a shot to use claude code for quick improvements to some projects.
