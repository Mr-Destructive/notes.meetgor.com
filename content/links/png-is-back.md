# PNG is back

**Link:** https://www.programmax.net/articles/png-is-back/

## Context

[Cloudflare Launches Containers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/containers-are-available-in-public-beta-for-simple-global-and-programmable/)
- [Google drops Gemini CLI as a terminal AI Agent](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/)
- [Anthropic allows build, host, and share interactive AI-powered apps directly in the Claude app](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts)

There are lot of things happening for tooling around these LLMs, no model launches hopefully for a few weeks. But the launches from Google are just not stopping, constant in the news. Anthropic is now trying to expand in different directions after anchoring their flagship model.
