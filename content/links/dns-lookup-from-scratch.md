## Context

This was a refreshing post, it made me think, Programming is not dead yet. I have lost the motivation in streaming because of AI, no one would watch someone code something for hours, but this is bringing that back. The joy, the delight, the satisfaction of coding your own DNS from scratch in C, elite programmer. I would recommend subscribing this guy, full of energy.
