# Left to Right Programming

## Context

If python looks odd, how about SQL? That is left to right but evaluated mostly from the right to left right? mostly I asking loosely here, though aggregates might be exceptions and other things I am not aware of.

    - Good points, yes python’s list comprehension is an outlier at it as it needs the last bit first to understand the whole context.
