## Context

5. [How AI writing supercharged an addictive pattern](https://bowendwelle.substack.com/p/ai-writing-addictive)
    - We'll have been there and done that. The initial WOW! to the glorious vibe crap that comes after 12 hours of prumpting.
    - I know there is a lot of value in AI, I am not a AI doomer, but the things people are assuming like 10x dev, replacing a junior dev, an intern, I don't buy that both emotionally and mentally. It just hurts the morale of humans to say that. If that is the case, then just flip the lever and let the software world be in chaos.
    - AI assisted coding can be a bit addictive I agree, that's why if there is some joy in my side project, I do start it myself and then ask AI bits and pieces to figure it out, I don't let it rip my project, I am still an advocate of chat based AI-assisted development. That friction of copy-pasta I can tolerate but not the shit-shoving of vibe coded mess.
