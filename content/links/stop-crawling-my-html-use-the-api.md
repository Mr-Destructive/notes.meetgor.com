## Context

4. [Stop crawling my html, use the API](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/stop-crawling-my-html-you-dickheads-use-the-api/)
    
    1. This is so funny, the API is in front of the user.. No LLM, but its so lazy to hit the API.
        
    2. Maybe we need another protocol for how AI should scrap data from websites, but scrapping is a thing that doesn't have a standard, or rather no one would follow it.
