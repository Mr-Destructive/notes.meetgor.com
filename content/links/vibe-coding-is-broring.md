# Vibe Coding is broring

**Link:** https://cassidoo.co/post/vibe-coding-yawn/

## Context

It is pathetic, really. Watching it clog some code and done. Sigh what is left out then, to read code? Who loves it. Vibe coding is cool and good if you just want the product in your hands, but if you care about the craft then please write it.
