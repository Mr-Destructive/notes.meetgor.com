**Link:** https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/

## Context

Competition is harsh here, Nano-banana is so good. yet its a little behind now. I don't know much about Nano banana Pro, but Image 1.5 might fall behind in its speed. Look at Nano banana, its zip zap image, Imagen is a slog. Not sure from the API though.
