# How long context fail

**Link:** https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html

## Context

This was an insightful observation, must know things before working with LLMs having a large context window, or even a short for that matter.
    - The needle in the haystack problem is not solved, and LLMs are very sensitive to getting up in a rabbit hole.
          - Context Poisoning
          - Context Distraction
          - Context Confusion
          - Context Clash
    - All of these reasons look the same, but can mean different things in different “CONTEXT”.
