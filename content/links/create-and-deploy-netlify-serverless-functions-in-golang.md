# Create and Deploy Netlify Serverless Functions in Golang

**Link:** https://youtu.be/BY2Z2Em7OdA

## Context

On the weekend, I experimented with how to deploy a Golang serverless function for the LibSQL database, and through that, I got to understand the cloud function deployment on Netlify with Golang. So, created a video for that on Sunday and published it on Monday.
