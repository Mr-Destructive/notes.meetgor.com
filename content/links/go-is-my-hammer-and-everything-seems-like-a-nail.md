## Context

[Go is my hammer and everything seems like a nail](https://www.maragu.dev/blog/go-is-my-hammer-and-everything-is-a-nail?ref=dailydev): I get that if someone loves to write in a language, it becomes instinct to use it everywhere, but this got me a bit of questioning, like really go for everything? Not sure, like surely could be used, but not necessarily should be used. Would you use Golang to code a frontend application? No right? It’s not meant to be, surely you could write HTML and say I coded a full-stack app in Golang, but really? Been there, done that. Doesn’t feel like touching the code again.
