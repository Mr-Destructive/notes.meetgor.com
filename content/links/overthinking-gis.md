# Overthinking GIS

## Context

1. [Overthinking GIS](https://scottsexton.co/post/overthinking_gis/)
    - This just triggered some neurons in my brains, some horses running. I got a bit of interest in exploring GIS data. Want to play with it, and find interesting details.
    - This post highlighted the ways to use GIS data to get the usability of a land, basically which are fertile and usable for farming I think. But the technicality in which it was explained was clicking the right knobs at the right time with the perfect steps and images.
    - Would be certainly writing a post in this style sometimes soon.
