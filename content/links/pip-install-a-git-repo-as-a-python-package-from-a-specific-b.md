## Context

* [Pip Install a git repo as a python package from a specific branch from the requriements.txt file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16584552/how-to-state-in-requirements-txt-a-direct-github-source): I was trying to install the python SDK for Appwrite but the latest release was not live yet, so decided to download the version branch from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-python/tree/1.6.x). However, that failed as in the Appwrtie function environment, or any cloud/serverless function ecosystem there won’t be git installed.
