# What is a Tensor? A beautiful intuition and question and answer based explanation

**Link:** https://youtu.be/k2FP-T6S1x0

## Context

This is a great piece of explanation. The question from Richard Feymann are so deep, provoking and sensible. The way the author explained and questioned his own thinking is really great. I liked that way of teaching. The direction bit and the animation also helped a lot. Nice editing skills.
