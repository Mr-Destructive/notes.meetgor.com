# Hugo + Obsidian + Git Pipeline

**Link:** https://hugo.insanelogs.xyz/posts/hugo-pipeline/

## Context

1. This blog gave me a idea to simplify my static site generator, instead of syncing with the database from github, I can just simply use a sqlite file and sync to the database an vice versa. Right now the problem is on the inconsistency in github content vs the database, so after having an in-memory or local file that can reside at any time on the repo, it would be easier to pull, push changes to the remote repository.
