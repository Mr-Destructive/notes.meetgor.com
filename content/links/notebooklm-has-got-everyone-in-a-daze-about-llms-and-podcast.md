## Context

[NotebookLM has got everyone in a daze about LLMs and podcasts](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/29/notebooklm-audio-overview/): I just dropped my portfolio link and it just spits out some compliments after compliments about my journey as a developer. It actually said certain things that I myself haven’t thought of someone viewing me, a couple of things were rubbish for sure, but it was pretty much factual.
