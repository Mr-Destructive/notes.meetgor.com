# Welcome to Gas Town

## Context

Agents as code generation orchestrators. This is quite a ambitious thing. I haven’t read the full post. But I can see where it goes. I haven’t either been in situations with 10s of these agents ripping in the background. There are reasons for them and some of them I am trying to overcome. I don’t have that many ideas honestly, this is flawed in my opinion, my biggest weakness maybe. I don’t have claude code as I don’t have much to spend on AI. I am limited by free options and some work related subscriptions. I am bogged down by the clumsy free models. The habit of abandoning a project after the setup is too evasive now. The earlier habit has just got more notorious with AI. That all said, I love this idea, the next step in AI is agents orchestration. Maybe I am behind it, but I had a few ideas, not exactly this but some level of parallel agents running. Not orchestrating. Maybe that idea is speaking more than ever. I thought someone solved it, but nope. Need to roll up the sleeves.
