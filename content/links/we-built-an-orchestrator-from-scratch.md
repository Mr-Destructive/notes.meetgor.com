# We built an orchestrator from scratch

**Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy2RJdDEvO0

## Context

* [We built an orchestrator from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy2RJdDEvO0): [Fly.io](http://Fly.io)  
    Why Flyio built their orchestrator, kind of. They use VMs which Kubernetes is not ideal for as it is designed for orchestrating containers, Nomad has a quirk of assigning a minimal number of VMs/machines for the users, which is not secure enough for [Fly.io](http://Fly.io), so reasonable enough that it is worth for them to write and Orchestrator from scratch (well not entirely from scratch)
