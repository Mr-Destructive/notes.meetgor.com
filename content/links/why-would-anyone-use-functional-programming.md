## Context

* [Why would anyone use Functional programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYR0eJdGBmQ): The Coding Gopher  
    Functional programming languages are designed to think about the what and not the how. So we just focus on the what things to implement and not care about how. So, there are things like functions, no variables no mutations (get out of here python).
