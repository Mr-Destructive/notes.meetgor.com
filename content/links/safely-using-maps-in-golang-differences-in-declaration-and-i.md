## Context

* [Safely using Maps in Golang: Differences in declaration and initialization](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-safely-using-maps/)  
    I said in the previous newsletter that I would write this article and I did it in the previous weekend. The title I thought versus what is actually there is quite different, I had a very specific problem with `url.Values` getting nil pointer access if not initiated, but I found out the underlying type is a map in golang, So this learning became applicable to maps in general. This is the reason I like to write blog posts, I get a deeper understanding of the problems and solutions than what I thought I knew of.
