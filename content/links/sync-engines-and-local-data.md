# Sync Engines and Local Data

## Context

This actually made me a bit curious about sync engines further. I was in confusion when I heard about it from Theo as he used it for T3 chat. It didn’t made sense at that time. It still doesn’t, as why syncing is required in a chat app, all the data comes from the backend, there is no processing on the frontend?
