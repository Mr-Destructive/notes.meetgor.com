## Context

2. [What makes a good software engineer](https://sanitarium.se/blog/2025/08/21/what-makes-a-good-software-engineer)
    - Curiosity to build the right thing, and being honest about it.
    - Trust is super valuable, I have experienced it working remotely at my 1+ year stay at my current company.
    - I often just do it for doing it, then I hit it with I need to know why this needs to be done and done correctly. Then things take shape, curiosity out performs every other emotion.
