# Google releases Gemma 3 with 270 Million parameter

**Link:** https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3-270m/

## Context

- [Google releases Gemma 3 with 270 Million parameter](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3-270m/)
    - Such a small model and perfect for low end devices, but not sure about the performance to intelligence ration. Obviously it will be small, but if its faster and as neck to neck as llama 1 Billion then that makes it really the best one out there in this range of parameters.

Was a bit of digital detox week, 2 days, I just did nothing but stare at the ceiling and out of my window. This gave me a mental reset and some good vibes to just live. Hoping to crush next few weeks.

See you in the next one!

Happy Coding :)
