# Google releases Gemma 3 with 270 Million parameter

**Link:** https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3-270m/

## Context

Such a small model and perfect for low end devices, but not sure about the performance to intelligence ration. Obviously it will be small, but if its faster and as neck to neck as llama 1 Billion then that makes it really the best one out there in this range of parameters.
