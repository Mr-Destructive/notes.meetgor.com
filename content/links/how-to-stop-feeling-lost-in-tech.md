## Context

1. [How to stop feeling lost in tech](https://www.yacinemahdid.com/p/how-to-stop-feeling-lost-in-tech))
    - This is a premium quality post. So much valuable advice for juniors and people who are all over the place and feeling overwhelmed or burned out.
    - What do you want to be in like 5 years, 3 years, 1 year? That hit me like a truck. I never think about the future, but still there needs to be specific I enjoy and would want to keep enjoying and learning. I know that's a too generic AI like answer but that is where the real friction will arise and I think we will emerge out of it with a fresh perspective. After having asked a lot of questions and having a better idea about our likes and dislikes, thinking without any pressure just gives us the opportunity to truly see beneath us.
    - I don't think the steps mentioned there are necessary, like I know this might be done for relaxing the user (taking leave in the middle of a week, going a entire day at the waffle-house or cafe). But the process is to the point.
    - Listing down the goals and what I want to be like a tree like structure, no cycles. Breaking down one goal from 5 year to 3, then 1 and then month and then weeks. That makes it really clear and forces us to double down on our true "calling" or the muse if you think in that way.
