## Context

- [Setup subdomains on Hostinger with a Domain-only Plan](https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/8907694-how-to-create-a-subdomain-without-a-hosting-plan): I was reading a blog of an author and found some hiccups on their website, some missing links, and redirects, this made me wander to the domain world. I began searching for domains, subdomains, and free hosting. I finally ended up at [this](https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/8907694-how-to-create-a-subdomain-without-a-hosting-plan) article, and it opened a huge world of possibilities, I had the ability to create subdomains on my domain meetgor.com, but never knew that I thought to do that, I had to purchase the hosting plan. Very nice marketing by Hostinger, clever. But, I am a developer and searching is my weapon.
