## Context

* [ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10193193-1-800-chatgpt-calling-and-messaging-chatgpt-with-your-phone) and [Perplexity](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1918138605203333264) make the chatbot available to chat on [WhatsApp](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1916947244852646202)
    
    * This is a bit of a hot take, it can be revolutionary, it is exposing the LLMs to a wider audience, adoption rate might go high. I am not negative or positive at the moment, but it’s kind of revolutionary to see this thing. Open AI is again heading a revolution(not able to lead, however).
