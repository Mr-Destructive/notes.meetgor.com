## Context

2.  [Backend Banter with Mitchell Hashimoto](https://youtu.be/586_BAMMOQ8):
    * I have watched it halfway through and so far some hot takes
    * Rust ecosystem is a little messed up to interact with for him at least
    * Zig fixes the pains of C, the build ecosystem (handles the compilation for us), and package management (like go)
    * Project-based learning for the win!!
    * He started to build Ghostty as a fun toy project, then found some pain points and tried to fix those with an ecosystem of libraries to build an  abstraction layer of apps on top of terminal emulation.
