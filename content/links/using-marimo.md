# Using marimo

**Link:** https://marimo.io/

## Context

[Using marimo](https://marimo.io/) to create,edit and work with python based notebooks. Marimo is a modern alternative to jupyter notebooks, you can port a ipynb file to marimo, as marimo stores directly as a python file. That is really neat. Marimo’s core feature, or I should say selling point is the reactive system. If you change a value of one variable in a cell, then all the cells referring that variable will be mutated, or changed. That is actually cool, and makes notebooks intuitive to use. I’ll be exploring more of those these weekend.
