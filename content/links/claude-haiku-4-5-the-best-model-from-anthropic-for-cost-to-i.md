## Context

Maybe its a big leap in terms of intelligence to cost ratio. We might get more cheaper models with more intelligence.
    - Open Models especially the China Models are pushing these AI Labs in a better direction. GLM and Kimi K2 have forced Anthropic to release this to stay competitive and able to sustain their growth.
    - Phew! What times to live in as a developer.
