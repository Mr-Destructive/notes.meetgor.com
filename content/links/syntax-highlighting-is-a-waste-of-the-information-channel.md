## Context

2. [Syntax highlighting is a waste of the information channel](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/syntax-highlighting-is-a-waste-of-an-information/)
    - This is unique thinking. I like it, I can see how it can help developers understand and read code. But having that specific mode toggled is quite challenging and worth digging into.
    - Tree sitter is quite the thing that we can use here, but toggling different modes in different contexts is quite absurd, I think.
    - How would you know which mode works in the given context? I guess you’ll have to try a few things and get a sense of what you are trying to learn from the code.
