## Context

This is unique thinking. I like it, I can see how it can help developers understand and read code. But having that specific mode toggled is quite challenging and worth digging into. Tree sitter is quite the thing that we can use here, but toggling different modes in different contexts is quite absurd, I think. How would you know which mode works in the given context? I guess you’ll have to try a few things and get a sense of what you are trying to learn from the code.
