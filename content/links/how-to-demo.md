# How to demo

**Link:** https://thorstenball.com/how-to-demo/

## Context

Some great advice on how to demo. It has some good catches. Keeping it shorter, slowly moving to the solution, not banging it in the start. Let the viewer understand the problem in its entirety then develop the intuition to your solution. Adding pictures add value, but I think it should be a concise representation of what is changing or what the crux of the presentation is, not just adding visuals just for the sake of it.
