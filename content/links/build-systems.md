## Context

[No docs, no bugs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/no-docs-no-bugs/)
    - This is silly; the more detail you put, the more detailed your tests have to be
    - The more tests there are, the probability of all of them passing would start decreasing, and hence, it could cause subtle bugs
    - So I think it is a matter of convincing yourself to write more tests and documentation
- [Nothing makes me want to hire someone less than them showing an open-to-work badge](https://christianheilmann.com/2025/05/20/nothing-makes-me-want-to-hire-someone-less-than-them-showing-an-open-to-work-badge/?ref=dailydev)
    - This is a good take, if someone has put an open-to-work badge, it might mean that the person is giving indication to his/her openness to work.
    - We can’t judge by that, and should not, as the person might be in a weird situation and can’t openly express their situation so the badge gives them a slight help in communicating without actually speaking about it.
- [Revenge of the junior developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer)
    - Ok, I spent half an hour reading this article and felt a mix of opinions
    - On one side, I am happy that I am a junior, I am dabbling with AI agents and tab tab things, but it’s kind of weird to use them.
    - I don’t like the review part, it feels like a daunting task
- [I really don’t like ChatGPT’s new memory feature change](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/21/chatgpt-new-memory/)
    - I haven’t used this, but I can understand the feeling of this
    - This looks like a feature without a button, a default feature. Really, are these big companies talking about AGI and care about the values, and slopping users with a bare minimum experience?
- [Glauber Costa on Technical Blogging](https://writethatblog.substack.com/p/glauber-costa-on-technical-blogging)
    - These are golden points here
          - Just write it down
          - Showcasing benchmarks is a bit hard
          - If you are not sure about it, reluctant about publishing it, just do it, as you don’t know what will work and what won’t until you haven’t done it.[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnDa!,w_56,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd526d858-d510-49e0-8e4c-bdb4bded946d_1024x1024.png)Write that blog!Glauber Costa on Technical BloggingWelcome to our latest attempt to (not-so) gently nudge you to write more!
