# Recommendations for getting most from technical books

**Link:** https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2025/reading-books.html

## Context

This is some gold advice on consuming technical content in general I think. Not just books. It could be a big blog post, video or any course. First consume it without distraction, try to understand next, try it on your own, try it again, think about what you want to do, do it and repeat from 2 again if you fail.
