preview_description: This short article compiles a few notes I previously shared when

  books. I follow a similar approach when I read technical books myself. It is not
  meant as a universal recipe, but it may be a helpful starting point. For this particular
  book, I strongly suggest reading it in order since each chapter depends on the previous
  one. And for each chapter, I recommend the following steps.

# Recommendations for getting most from technical books

## Context

This is some gold advice on consuming technical content in general I think. Not just books. It could be a big blog post, video or any course. First consume it without distraction, try to understand next, try it on your own, try it again, think about what you want to do, do it and repeat from 2 again if you fail.
