## Context

- OpenAI marks ‘Code Red’ amidst escalating competition from Google and Anthropic and open models from China

[Django 6.0 released](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/dec/03/django-60-released/)[Mistral 3 family of models released](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3)[Ghostty is now non-profit](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit)I want to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rsBaTRI7Is). It just intrigued me, I have been a django developer till late 2023. But then, AI came in and here I am. I haven’t touched Django development since then. I want to see why it might be the case, I suspect its due to ai automating the boilerplate code? Maybe the repetitive and boilerplatey code is no more a cognition on the developers, AI is doing it with flask for them. Not sure. Watch it to find out.That’s it from this week. I have been out of sync in tech for a while. Need to get hands on and create a few project, the itch is there, just procrastination is holding me back. Let’s see if this year I can complete Advent of Code, in Golang of course, need to learn tests, more concurrent operations and stuff.
