## Context

This was super cool, the way it was visualized and taught.
    - I adore Brain Yu, he is a master teacher. I learnt Python and Django from him.
    - B-trees are basically trees with an equal number of leaf nodes. No unbalanced roots. The operations to make the insertion and deletion made it really awesome for understanding.
