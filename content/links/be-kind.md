# Be Kind

## Context

* [Be Kind](https://boz.com/articles/be-kind) :
    
    * As a developer, we need to be kind, not just yes, thank you but really understand the person from the other end and be humble about his/her situation and feelings.
        
    * That might be too realistic for a developer to do (right? We are nerds, I think), but having that kindness and insight about the person we are interacting with sets us apart as an effective engineer.
