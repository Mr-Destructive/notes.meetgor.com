# Writing first tooling second

**Link:** https://susam.net/writing-first-tooling-second.html

## Context

True, gold. This is to the point and another way of saying, “Show, don’t tell”, so “Write, don’t setup” The blog is merely one possible organising principle, not a requirement. I started the same way. I picked up hashnode, then moved to jekyll and github pages, then used python via markata (waylon walker’s ssg), an ssg that someone else wrote and I loved it, it was what I needed, the control of what goes in and out and also it was easy to see what was happening so that I can change and remove what I wanted. I finally now am rolling my own SSG in Golang and a CMS system. I am not very consistent in sticking to one cms, I have built 3-4 versions of them. But the thing is I still post consistently. Not long form posts, but these reflective posts and short bursts of thinking. Write your brain out first, then eventually it will outgrow to your needs, the system will be formed not shoved in. Like earlier I just used to write long form how-to-guides or tutorials, then I started to write reflections weekly, then link posts tils and suddenly I had 10 types of posts. Article, Tutorials, TILs, Thoughts, Link-blog, Newsletter, Notes, and what not.
