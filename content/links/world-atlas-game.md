# World Atlas Game

**Link:** https://worldatlas.meetgor.com/

## Context

This is vibe coded in a day. Gemini CLI and Amp. Just ripped it I read Golang was good to work with AI Agents, thought of building some backend with it and lo behold, it did one shot it almost. For the frontend I choose Vue. Surprisingly its a great UI. I am honestly impressed. I didn’t write a single line of code, let even see. I always wanted to make this, but was very lazy to do all of the meddling with the boilerplatey code, it just did in a few minutes.
