## Context

6. [What would Kubernetes 2.0 be like](https://matduggan.com/what-would-a-kubernetes-2-0-look-like/): YAML should be replaced with HCL, that is a golden point. No like seriously, reading a long yaml file just gives me headache. I prefer JSON Instead. Also the helm package manager is written in Golang, I want to dive deeper into K8s.
