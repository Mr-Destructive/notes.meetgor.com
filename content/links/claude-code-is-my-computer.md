# Claude Code is my Computer

**Link:** https://steipete.me/posts/2025/claude-code-is-my-computer

## Context

I see this with many developers, not just newbies or just soydevs, but also veteran and knowledgeable developers, too. They seem to have a liking towards Claude code.
    - I know the feeling I think after using Amp, Warp, Gemini CLI to some extent.
    - But this is a bit of avoiding the chores part, which is fine.
