## Context

- [Mistral with Devstral](https://mistral.ai/news/devstral)
    - This is a 14 GB, 23 Billion Parameter model for coding task
    - Not sure about performance but it requires 32 GB Ram to run, so I am out of uck on that.
    - Waiting for a slight lightweight model. Qwen is a great model in that sense.
