## Context

* [A Revolution in how robots learn](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/12/02/a-revolution-in-how-robots-learn) (40-minute read)  
    I read it on a Sunday morning and I was just in awe with the writing and the flow of one example to other. The way the author describes every act of robots learning with the example of his kids is really touching and makes it so human. Worth my time.
