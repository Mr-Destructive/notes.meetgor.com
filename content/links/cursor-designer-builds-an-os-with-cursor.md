# Cursor designer builds an OS with cursor

**Link:** https://youtu.be/TQhv6Wol6Ns

## Context

This is wild, I cannot believe this, it was created by AI, half baked but still. I think it takes time to clean up the vibe-coded mess, often then not, I have to re-read and re-read until I scrape it off completely. But this just doesn’t feel natural. It might be but I am not convinced. It just feels a high effort thing, not as the author described it. “Just two prompts”, “completed in an afternoon”. I am not sure that is true, could be skill issue on my end but cannot comprehend at the moment.
