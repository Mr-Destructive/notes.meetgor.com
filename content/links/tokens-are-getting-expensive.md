# Tokens are getting expensive

## Context

Geez, that is a lot of money. Models are really a way to fool and cash out money from people, these AI labs have just turned LLMs to be money making machines.

Didn’t watch anything apart from this in tech, read a lot of things this week, so off out of social media for a while.
