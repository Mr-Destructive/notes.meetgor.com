## Context

I have been keeping an eye on turso, I really like the product, but now after watching it and hearing the mindset and approach of the company, I feel I need to get involved and contribute to this.
    - This is such a great learning experience, I had cloned and ran the project locally last week and would find quirks and new features to implement next week.
