## Context

- [Rewriting SQLite from scratch: Database School, Glauberg Costa, CEO of Turso](https://youtu.be/010OKqc3ObM)
    - I have been keeping an eye on turso, I really like the product, but now after watching it and hearing the mindset and approach of the company, I feel I need to get involved and contribute to this.
    - This is such a great learning experience, I had cloned and ran the project locally last week and would find quirks and new features to implement next week.
    - In a nutshell, turso started as a SQLite fork, but they realised the embedded replicas, the server and all the other things around sqlite were just hacks and they needed something better to support it natively. And hence Turso (limbo) was born which is a sqlite written ground up from RUST. I was amazed to see almost all the features are supported out of the box in this repo.
