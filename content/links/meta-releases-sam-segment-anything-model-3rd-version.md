# Meta Releases SAM - Segment Anything Model 3rd version

**Link:** https://ai.meta.com/sam3/

## Context

I am sick of these tactics from both OpenAI and Anthropic. [Meta Releases SAM - Segment Anything Model 3rd version](https://ai.meta.com/sam3/) This week and the next week or so are quite busy, I’ll be travelling out from home. So might miss out on next week’s edition. Its wedding season, and I have no power to refuse the invitation, forcefully or willingly, I’ll have to do my duty as a family member. Anyway, will catch up some other week for a fresh or exhausted fortnight. For more news, follow the [Hackernewsletter](https://buttondown.com/hacker-newsletter/archive/772/) (#772nd edition), and for software development/coding articles, join [daily.dev](http://daily.dev/).
