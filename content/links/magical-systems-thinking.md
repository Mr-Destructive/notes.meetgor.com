preview_description: Systems thinking promises to give us a toolkit to design complex
  systems that work from the ground up. It fails because it ignores that systems fight
  back.

# Magical Systems Thinking

**Link:** https://worksinprogress.co/issue/magical-systems-thinking/

## Context

I love this post, it hits home for me Systems should grow from the simplest possible solutions and then branch off from the possibilities and situations. Creating patches to the existing systems will only survive for limited time or none at all. Sundar Pichai estimated in late 2024 that over 25 percent of Google’s code was AI generated; as of mid-2025, the figure for Anthropic is 80–90 percent. The comparison to AI slop is great and fits well here. Vibe coded mess is no exception to systems thinking. We have seen LLMs want to patch and keep on patching existing code mess, we want to start from scratch, the urge is right, but we worry about whether we will lose the progress? The progress is fake progress. The code LLM produces will always be throwaway code, as it is no subconsciously written, call me philosophical, but code is art and it needs attention form a human soul in order for it to work, not technically but overall in order to complete its purpose. NEW SYSTEMS CREATE NEW PROBLEMS’ and ‘THE SYSTEM ALWAYS KICKS BACK’. As systems become more complex, they become more chaotic, not less. The best solution remains humility, and a simple system that works.
