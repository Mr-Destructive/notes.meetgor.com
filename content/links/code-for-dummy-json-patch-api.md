# Code for dummy json patch API

**Link:** https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/dummy-json-patch

## Context

[Code for dummy json patch API](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/dummy-json-patch): This is a dummy, a demonstration-only API, will add a documentation page and more to it as I write the Golang HTTP PATCH method article. Hosted on netlify, took some time to understand the patch request and constructed the json-patch endpoint, will also add in a json merge patch endpoint.
