## Context

* [Horseless Carriages](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/) :
    
    * This was a great read. People making AI-based applications are too naive to understand the actual technology behind LLM and how the approach needs to be changed.
        
    * Right now, it is the assumption that the developer is attached to the system prompt; however, LLMs at this stage need customisation from the user perspective and ndo ot have the dependency on the developer.
        
    * The shift in developer-user responsibility is quite unnoticed, and this article highlights that effectively.
