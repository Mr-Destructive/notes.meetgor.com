## Context

* [Why is Google winning the AI race](https://youtu.be/A0V4km88tFc?si=pi7v7rThMEZ8QcCz)?
    
    * Google has controlled the internet for the past 2 decades, and it has Data, some model science, and also now has some infrastructure (hardware). It will control the AI race, Apple is actually surprising in all of them but dominates none of them.
        
    * Can Apple make a comeback? Looks hard, but we have seen comebacks (Google was struggling with Bard, and now it is toppling Open AI)
