## Context

* [Why you should make a New programming language](https://ntietz.com/blog/you-should-make-a-new-terrible-programming-language/): This blog actually hit me and gave me a hint of my old project of Substack Markdown Parser. So have started to read a couple of blogs and books mentioned in this blog to start understanding interpreters.
