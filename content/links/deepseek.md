## Context

[Anthropic finally launches the voice mode in its model](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11101966-using-voice-mode-on-claude-mobile-apps)
    - Finally anthropic is adding voice mode. I love the way that anthropic comes at everything from behind and takes everything at it head, hopefully here will be the same.
    - The code part, the thinking part, the editing part of code is so reliable in Claude, however the search part I am not sure of.
- [Mistral launches AI Agents API](https://mistral.ai/news/agents-api)
    - Every company is launching remote agents
    - Jules from Google, Codex from OpenAI
    - Now mistral, they have similar things
          - Python code environment
          - GitHub integration
    - This seems to be inching slightly up and a less heavier model than devstral or other models runnable in a single GPU or limited RAM
    - Let’s see how community tests and where it ranks over the week
