# Local LLMs are how nerds justify a big computer they don’t need

## Context

Curiosity gets the better of them. I have a 8GB device, I can barely run a 1B parameter model. I get frustrated but have nothing to complain. I can use ChatGPT in temporory mode, or incognito mode if I don’t want it to attach it to the memory. I don’t see using local models on scale is justifiable just yet.
