## Context

This was a good one **When you truly chase your highest potential, everything you thought was burnout will melt away.** Because you weren’t suffering from too much work, you were suffering from too little truly important work. Like a boy who thought he was full until dessert arrives, you’ll suddenly find your hunger return! Some really good points Pause once a month to make sure you’re still on the right track. Stop once a year to triple-check you’re on the right track. But never get off this path towards your highest potential.

When I’m writing about something personal, 1,000+ words can easily flow for me in an afternoon. Just read the post!
