## Context

9. [Gemini CLI breakdown by Simon Wilson](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/gemini-cli/)
    - Google has really taken the time to build something of high-enough standard in the space of AI Agents in the terminal. This is a serious competition to Claude Code.
    - I wonder what OpenAI missed with Codex. It just is bad. Not even usable to free users, which Google just took it by storm.

    - The system prompt is really insightful, the tools are nicely laid out, its so simple yet well architectured.
