## Context

It as simple as this `year, month, day = 2025, 11, 05 if month < 3: month = month + 12 year = year - 1 k = year % 100 j = year // 100 day_digit = (day + (13 * (month+1)) // 5 + k + k // 4 + j // 4 + 5 * j) % 7 # 0 is Saturday, 1 is Sunday and so on.`## Tech News [Moonshot.ai](http://Moonshot.ai) releases [Kimi K2 Thinking model](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/thinking.html)For more news, follow the [Hackernewsletter](https://buttondown.com/hacker-newsletter/archive/770/) (#770th edition), and for software development/coding articles, join [daily.dev](http://daily.dev).It was a fun start of the penultimate month of 2025. Hopefully, the rest of the month go just like this and I will have most of my goals of the year completed.
