# 2025, The year in LLMs: Simon Willison Weblog

## Context

Boy! That is a lot! I have been saying “overwhelming” word was not sufficient to describe this tend of LLMs in 2025. This explains the reason We had LLAMA falling, Gemini gripping, OpenAI still on the top yet cornered neck to neck suddenly with Chinese Labs and Anthropic in its own league. We saw the sudden rise and sudden dip in vibe coding, people thought “We can be programmers! We don’t need developers anymore, hehe” to “Damm! Do I need a developer to debug this?”. That was a funny thing to watch (as a developer) The images and 6 second video clip generated by AI are mind boggling, we saw from Sora and Nano Banana what havoc they can wreck if put in untamed hands. Local models are getting good, but the speed of the cloud and advancement over the other side is rocketing. There is also this trend of cli based agents. Claude code just set the trend and let 100s of cli agents rip off in the months to follow. Those are still released by new companies every now and then. Slop, yeah! We had less human slop than we needed AI right? Thanks to Simon Sir for this awesome blog. It finally gives me a relief to read so many thing have happened at a glance
