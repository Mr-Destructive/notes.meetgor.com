## Context

Yes, just bury all the expectation for once and do what you truly want to. I think this weekend, I would build a TUI for GCP Cloud Logger. Because I want to. No expectations. I don’t want to livestream, things get in the way, I don’t have the right set of mental clarity to write golang posts, I won’t for now. I’ll do what I love write now, things are overwhelming me. SQL, LLMs, VLLMs, Transformers, Vibe coding, PDFs, Rust, everything seems to sucking out the joy out of me, they are all great things, but I can’t handle them all at once. One thing at a time, and for this weekend, its TUI for GCP Cloud Logger, for sure. [Why I stopped trying to be a great engineer](https://supremecodr.medium.com/-56094c225549)- This is a wholesome post. Just read it, its so short.
