# Command line tools I Like

**Link:** https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/command-line-tools-i-like-2022/

## Context

This was a nice post on the aggregated tools that the author uses most of the time and are quite handy. I also use most of the tools everyday and would like to create a dev container for the setup of my preferred editor/tools and shells and plugins and all that good stuff.
