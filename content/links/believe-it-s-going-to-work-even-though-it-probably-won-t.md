  Startup founders are strong-headed, which is what I also agree upon. And like everything in life, it is a double-edged sword. Everything has pros and cons, but to not be cut by the other edge, you have to sharpen the other; you can’t dismiss the other edge but keep on sharpening the other one.
  Sorry, that was a weird tangent. Startup founders need to be strong-headed because it’s their dream to build and grow; if they stop defending themselves, then the team just disintegrates.
