# You cannot not lead

**Link:** https://thoughtbot.com/blog/you-cannot-not-lead

## Context

This is so subtle, yet perfect. You lead by good or a bad way. You cannot say I was not the leader when you are the only person building and maintaining it. You lead by examples, good or bad. Average sucks you know? You are either good or extremely bad. You cannot not lead. Wow! This post is so perfect, not only fits the manager but also every human, a elder human trying to teach or lead a younger one. The younger one learns from the examples and behavior of the leader.
