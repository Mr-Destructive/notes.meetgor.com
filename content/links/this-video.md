## Context

[Playful Programming](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/playful-programming):  
    I want to watch that video, there is so much explained by Thorsten, should be worth watching then, he is a great deep-diving programmer, can’t ignore his recommendations. Just by reading at the explanations of his observations on the video, it seems there is a lot to learn. Next week will be in the watched section.

    * [How Raviraj Achar reads books with limited time](https://newsletter.techleadmentor.com/p/how-i-read-books-with-limited-time):  
        Time is really limited, like everything around you seems to drag into it, the phone most importantly, it feels like a reservoir of knowledge but not wisdom. Taking the time to read is a sign of a level of control over the mind and grit. The process by Raviraj seems a little too complicated or farfetched like Readwise and Notion, those add a lot of friction. I don’t use those tools, I use this newsletter to sift my learnings and tech reading.
