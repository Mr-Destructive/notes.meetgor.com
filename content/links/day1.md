## Context

* [AOC in Golang Day 1: Missing ABS() for Integers](https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/aoc-day1-golang)
    
    This was a really well-researched and interesting article about why there is no Absolute function for integers. It makes sense now, but I still feel it could handle the general use cases so it shouldn’t be an issue. But yes there is a genuine reason for that to not exist in the standard library.
