# Nothing makes me want to hire someone less  than them showing an open-to-work badge

## Context

This is a good take, if someone has put an open-to-work badge, it might mean that the person is giving indication to his/her openness to work.
    - We can’t judge by that, and should not, as the person might be in a weird situation and can’t openly express their situation so the badge gives them a slight help in communicating without actually speaking about it.
