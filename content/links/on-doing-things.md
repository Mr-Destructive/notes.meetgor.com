## Context

Adding pictures add value, but I think it should be a concise representation of what is changing or what the crux of the presentation is, not just adding visuals just for the sake of it. [On doing things](https://jalexine.github.io/on-doing-things.html)- I don’t know nature is hinting this week to me to just do things. Right, I’ll do it. Sometimes ideas come when you stop trying to force them.
