# RSS is not dead

## Context

- [RSS is not dead](https://youtu.be/hSgpW0j2eOk)
    - RSS is not dead. Wow! I just had this vision of building a read later app a few weeks back, when the Pocket was deprecated. I want to build a combination of Read it later and RSS reader, a sync engine is something that might be used here if using cross-platform.
    - Now I understand the conversation here, if someone is fetching the posts and storing metadata then it makes sense to have a paid solution.

    - But the other point I am afraid of is the content scraping, is it ethical to do that? Like I know its not stealing, but crawling a legit site and using it on other platform is not good for link building for the author of the original article right? I am not sure, need a bit of thinking and ethical considerations.
