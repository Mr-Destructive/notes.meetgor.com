# RSS is not dead

## Context

RSS is not dead. Wow! I just had this vision of building a read later app a few weeks back, when the Pocket was deprecated. I want to build a combination of Read it later and RSS reader, a sync engine is something that might be used here if using cross-platform.
    - Now I understand the conversation here, if someone is fetching the posts and storing metadata then it makes sense to have a paid solution.
