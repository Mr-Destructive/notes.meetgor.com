# Nanochat

**Link:** https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat

## Context

- [Nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat)
    - Looks like a great way to learn about how models are trained. A very thought-through learning resource as well as a production-grade model builder.
    - Unfortunately, I don’t have GPUs, so I cannot run it to test my hypothesis.
