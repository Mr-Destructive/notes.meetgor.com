## Context

We don’t know what this will do to the learning and knowledge bowl of humans, but it might have an impact, good or bad. It's a pivotal moment in internet history. We are either full-on AI or superhumans. [Building from First Principles](https://marvinh.dev/blog/building-from-first-principles/)- Agreed. Jargon creates back and forth between people. It leads to more confusion and bugs. Make it simple, you don’t need a 10-document-long API spec, a simple line can serve the purpose if the intention and the why is clear.
