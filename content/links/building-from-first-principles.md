# Building from First Principles

**Link:** https://marvinh.dev/blog/building-from-first-principles/

## Context

Agreed. Jargon creates back and forth between people. It leads to more confusion and bugs. Make it simple, you don’t need a 10-document-long API spec, a simple line can serve the purpose if the intention and the why is clear. Keep it simple and studpid, this is a well known advice and it should be injested in AI workflows, they create bloat and make it impossible to review the complex tree of code.
