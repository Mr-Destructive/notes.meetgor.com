# Cloudflare launches a Python runtime for serverless functions

**Link:** https://blog.cloudflare.com/streamable-http-mcp-servers-python/

## Context

* [Cloudflare launches a Python runtime for serverless functions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/streamable-http-mcp-servers-python/)
    
    * This is interesting, Cloudflare has Python runtime for serverless functions for quite some time now. I found that a few months back. It’s kind of there, and not. As it’s a Pyodide runtime and not a native Python runtime, so there are limitations there. Only a few selected packages are compatible or made available to the Pydodide runtime.
        
    * Kind of limiting, since other providers like Appwrite, Vercel, support full-fledged support for Python

Phew — that was a long, wild week. Feels like the whole ecosystem is shifting under our feet. Everything’s speeding up. If I had to bet, next week’s bombshell will come from Google or Anthropic — probably on May the 4th. Just a feeling.

That’s it for this week, will see you in the next one!
