# The great SQLite rewrite

**Link:** https://bytes.dev/archives/407

## Context

1. It is a serious thing.
    2. People at Turso are seriously building it, it’s not a honey pot, last week I think they rewarded a thousand or more money to a person who actually found a bug in the Turso Rust version.
