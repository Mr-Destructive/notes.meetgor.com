**Link:** https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html

## Context

* [**df to\_json is a handy way to dump a data frame**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html) when looking for something very minute or finding some pattern
    
    I discovered that [`df.to`](http://df.to)`_json` is a function available to dump out a data frame to a JSON file which is quite nice and handy. I did use it to export a data frame in a notebook to a file while I was debugging a few things, and this function came in like a savior in the sea of lots of data.
