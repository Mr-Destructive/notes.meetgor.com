# Now might be the best time to learn software development

## Context

1. [Pheonix. new Fly’s entry for AI coding agents](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/23/phoenix-new/)
    - This is a neat little thing from fly.io, they have made everything so right, that these AI Agents just fit perfectly in their ecosystem.
2. [Using AI right now: A quick guide](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/using-ai-right-now-a-quick-guide)
    - Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude these are the most widely adopted LLMs which are quite general purpose. But they also have nuanced quirks and preferences for certain tasks.
    - Deep Research is a big deal and it has helped me learn a new concept every day. I use Grok AI, Gemini AI, Chat GPT and even mistral ai for specific things.
    - Hallucinations are no longer a big deal in AI, they have reduced considerably over the years. It is still a problem but not what it used to be.
3. [SQL Join flavors](https://antonz.org/sql-join/)
    - This was a insightful post, it helped me feed my hunger for learning more about SQL.
    - The qualified, natural (Actually unnatural) and cross broad range of joins really helped understand the concepts better.
    - The interactive examples are really great for those types of complex yet powerful concepts.
4. [AI-free Writing](https://antonz.org/ai-free/)
    - Anton won’t use AI for writing, I am on his side. I write this newsletter and any writing for that matter without GPT or AI. Yes, I use it as a critique and help me understand how it reads, I read its thoughts and think and leave them. Next time, I be a little considerate about those mistakes.
5. [Golang 1.25 interactive tour](https://antonz.org/go-1-25/)
    - The json v2 package and the in-depth explanations are helpful in quick understanding of the changes. It has given me a good view on what is changing and is enough motivation for me to tinker on my own and create other examples.
6. [Anatomy of a SQL Engine: Dolthub Blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-25-sql-engine-anatomy/)
    - This was a interesting post. It made me curious how a sql statement query is executed, the ast construction, then right recursive and left recursive. This blog actually made me take a in-depth guide on SQL.
    - I have started reading about SQL and solving leetcode problems and even some problems on SQLBolt. I have even picked up reading “Learning SQL” Book for learning more. I want to get into “Database Internals”, that book is about how under-the-hood sql and databases work, for that I need to learn what SQL is in the first place.
7. [Docker launches hardened base images](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-hardened-images/)
    - DHI are the new thing in docker, they help in avoiding the image bloat.
    - They are not just trimmed-down versions of existing containers, they’re built from the ground up which is really interesting to work with and help optimise the build process as well as deployment constraints.

  > Docker Hardened Images start with a dramatically reduced attack surface, up to 95% smaller, to limit exposure from the outset.
8. [Kubernetes isn’t for you](https://dev.to/code42cate/kubernetes-isnt-for-you-2c2m)
    - Kubernetes is made for the scale of google, where they have millions, billions of request per minute. Not for your 100 user startup. True, if the scale keep growing, or you have micro-service architecture, but if you have a bare-bones project and not many user-base, then sticking to simple traditional deployment is good enough
    - I hate when people use shiny things for making themselves look like they know what they are doing, the soy devs, the gigachad 100x developers, and they only know what a pod actually means in a cluster.
    - Why make things complex, it feels great at first for our egoistic brain, but believe me the complexity will hurt you in the long run. Maybe it will save you too if you are actually growing at scale. But the trade-off you need to decide.
9. [Gemini CLI breakdown by Simon Wilson](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/gemini-cli/)
    - Google has really taken the time to build something of high-enough standard in the space of AI Agents in the terminal. This is a serious competition to Claude Code.
    - I wonder what OpenAI missed with Codex. It just is bad. Not even usable to free users, which Google just took it by storm.

    - The system prompt is really insightful, the tools are nicely laid out, its so simple yet well architectured.
    - The best time to learn software development was 5 years ago, now is the next best time to learn it.
