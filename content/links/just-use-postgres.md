# Just use Postgres

**Link:** https://youtu.be/IdyK8XB2l6g

## Context

Wow! I love this. I want to write a technical book too. It is such a great adventure to be in. But burnout seems to be stronger there. I love Postgres can be used as a message queue, gen ai application, full text search I knew and JSON was obvious. Getting deep into the tech is important, I need to focus on thing at a time.
