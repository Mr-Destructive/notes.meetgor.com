# AI should be free software

## Context

Yikes, this looks like a good take on LLMs being free and open weight. If not, the larger AI labs might offer ads into the LLM suggestions. This, just the thought of it makes me wiggle with fear. It might push us in wired directions. The point of drawing a line of “our goal” vs “model’s goal” becomes hazy and it just doesn’t align with human values. Its a pretty hard problem to solve if it goes in a bad direction, which it seems to be at the moment.
