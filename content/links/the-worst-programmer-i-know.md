# The worst programmer I know

## Context

* [The worst programmer I know](https://dannorth.net/the-worst-programmer/): Yes, this is true. Some engineers or programmers do not actually work on something, but they make something work together. They are the hand-holders, the captains, the leads (not the tech lead, the leaders). That is one type of personality, and that is no right or wrong personality. Humans just are what they are, that’s what makes them humans. This brings me to another point, pair programming, oh! That is a charm, a secret little thing that somehow works wonders. Pair programming is a must, no matter what the scale of the organization is, it opens up the programmer’s mind in different ways, changes the perspectives of individuals, gives confidence, helps learn communication, eases the stress a bit, and makes programming more fun. I can go on, but that is an understatement for pair programming.
