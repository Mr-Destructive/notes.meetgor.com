## Context

- [Anthropic raises $13B Series F at $183B post-money valuation](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation)
    - I don’t know what that means, but is a big thing according to the big tech bros.

Nothing happening for a few weeks now, finally there is a slow down in the models and all this hype. I want this hype to be minimum as possible for a stretched duration of time, as it helps learn and do things peacefully.
