## Context

[A project is not a bundle ot tasks](https://secondthoughts.ai/p/a-project-is-not-a-bundle-of-tasks)- This is one of the best and practically grounded takes on the progress on AI. If it can’t make a decision that lasts longer, it might collapse eventually. AI Coding has improved over the last year for sure, but is it there? Not really. A developer still has to understand the logic, think about the AI answers, there has to be a human intuition and judgement to make its way to a sustainable solution.
