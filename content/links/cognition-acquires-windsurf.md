# Cognition acquires Windsurf

**Link:** https://cognition.ai/blog/windsurf

## Context

[Kimi AI K2](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/): This is probably the largest open weights model out in the wild, and that too probably the first that is really beating the state of the art models in tool calling and agentic coding. A huge standard leveller for open source community. There are quirks about the license but its pretty commendable in terms of what they have achieved.
- [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/): Amazon out of thin air just blew this up. Its almost like Cursor but with more controlled and flexible using preferences. It almost forces developers to plan and thoroughly consider the most tedious and boring part (sometimes the most exciting) of the development which is defining the problem and listing the features.
- [ChatGPT releases Agents](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/): This is like a thing that we all knew was coming but is late on the tables. Need to check it out if that is available for free users or not. If yes, then will be quite a fun thing to do and learn.
