# BYOK AI Chat

**Link:** https://byok-chat-dev.vercel.app/

## Context

- Render is the new Heroku for free application deployment
    - I used it to deploy my FastAPI backend for BYOK AI Chat App.
    - Its similar to the old Heroku hobby tier plan, which was vindicated in 2022.
    - I am not sure how reliable these Platform-As-A-Service are anymore after the Heroku sunset of hobby plan, but nonetheless its what we get from a free tier and its worth appreciating such companies are providing free tiers.
    - I am wondering can Appwrite take over its spot, its more of a microservice oriented setup but still it has a lot of potential to compete in the space.
