## Context

- [Gemini CLI and comparison with other Agentic Terminal Agents](https://youtu.be/ftGPty-dQR8?si=rryJ-7UL1K2IkXCZ)
    - Gemini CLI is really nice, at least for a free tier. I can use it and understand the LLMs capabilities. It helps junior developers get a taste of the software AI can produce, but these can really get double edged sword. Juniors will only produce AI slop and never learn anything.
    - But yes, google is trying hard to make developers happy for now.
