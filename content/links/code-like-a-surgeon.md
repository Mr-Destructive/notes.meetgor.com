## Context

- I don’t like breaks, maybe it might be necessary in some point of time in someones life, the situation might demand it. But just because you have the option, I don’t like taking it. I think forcing yourself to work brings you the skill of consistency and trust. 

[Code like a surgeon](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/10/24/code-like-a-surgeon)- Knowing what to hand off and what to roll your sleeves . Knowing that is cirtical. I think it comes off from experience and time, you will fail in making decisions, but it would make you aware what you are capable of and what will take time.

[It's insulting to read your AI-generated blog post](https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/)- I will never ever try to use AI in writing. Becuase I want to think, otherwise what is the purpose of doing anything. If humans just hand off every bit of things to AI what is the moat of humans?
