# Analogies are not always good: Comparing VACUUM in Postgres with free in C

**Link:** https://substack.com/home/post/p-167661543

## Context

Well, this is a off-topic write-up I felt writing because no one seems to have compared VACUUM in Postgres and free in C.
    - Those 2 might look unrelated but for understanding it makes a lot of sense. Actually I learnt that VACUUM is not like free, but VACUUM FULL does look like free.
    - My point is drawing analogies is good but not when you are not sure of either of them, it could look good on the high level talks, but getting a little deeper will shatter the comparison if not thought carefully.
