## Context

- [Learning Pydantic AI in Marimo](https://www.youtube.com/live/ujQjqqBka-8?si=SDf9b7waWu30c5yR)
    - This was the video of the week, I learnt a lot of stuff. One being, marimo is something I need to try as fast as possible and make it my go to tool for anything prototyping in python.
    - The discussion around Agent and LLMs is so beautiful.
    - Adding `Type_1 | str` is so so useful, It just opens up so many possibilities. The entire Agent concept could be made possible due to this.
    - Because if you are expecting a type in return but there is no enough information to return, the model has to forcefully return a value which might not be great, by just adding a | str it would then ask the user to fill in the details. Extremely well designed library.
