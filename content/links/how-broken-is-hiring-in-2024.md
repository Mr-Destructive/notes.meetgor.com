# How broken is hiring in 2024?

**Link:** https://cropp.blog/2024/08/job-searching-in-2024-is-horribly-broken?ref=dailydev

## Context

Being a fresher in 2024, I have experienced it quite closely from the glimpse of the beginning of this phase after Q3 in 2023, where I applied almost 100 applications without a single interview—finally landed an interview and working in that company today. What a ride it has been, 100+ applications, 1 interview to crack the job, skills issues? maybe but I think it could be timing issues.
