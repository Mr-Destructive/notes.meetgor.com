## Context

2. [AI Efficiency? Give me a break](https://luolink.substack.com/p/ai-efficiency-give-me-a-break)
    1. People are seeing it, people are coping now.
    2. AI is good, but not great. It has its value but the hype people created is 200x the value. Please, use AI I don’t refrain it, but everything has its moderation and area of use. AI for ART is pointless and gives existential crisis, refrain, I am not sure where it could be used without a thought blindly. In programming? yes to some extent in generating throwaway scripts or prototypes.
