# Lessons on AI Agents from Claude plays Pokemon

**Link:** https://youtu.be/CXhYDOvgpuU

## Context

Wow, agents are already playing games, not exactly, but quite fair, I would say. Anthropic is really a lab, like they are researching LLM behaviors through and through; they are technical scientists.
        
    * Claude plays Pokémon Red:
        
        * Send a screenshot of the current state
            
        * Describe the game mechanics
            
        * Ask for the action
            
        * Iterate
            
    * It’s quite a fascinating experiment. Maybe we can try with different types of games with LLMs. They tried a Pokémon-like game, because that is a very user-paced game, not a very rapid pace, or live-like games. Very smooth transitions and turn based game.
