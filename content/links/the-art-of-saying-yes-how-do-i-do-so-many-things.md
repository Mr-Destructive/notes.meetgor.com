## Context

4. [The art of saying yes: How do I do so many things](https://brittanyellich.com/say-yes-do-all-the-things/)
    1. Totally relatable post, I do a lot of things, because I am curious and excited to learn about it.
    2. Starting small, building momentum, building a habit, is really what got me into this exact newsletter, one brings other, I kept writing one week after other and here I am writing the 54th edition. Not all weeks are fair, the same intensity or energy, some are dull, frustrating, just barely pushing past, but there are mostly the weeks where I know what I am doing, why I am here writing the post, full of curiosity, eager to learn more, and break prod.
