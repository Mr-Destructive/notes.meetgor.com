  website that keeps all my data locally. Why do I care about bookmarks, and how does
  my new site work?

# Creating a static site for all my bookmarks

**Link:** https://alexwlchan.net/2025/bookmarks-static-site/

## Context

I am very much this kind of person, I want to access my bookmarks and the linkblog too. I am developing it, but can’t make it polished enough to be usable. I had created linkblog.netlify.app. This is work in progress, anyone can add but I would like to add the authentication, but that again creates a friction element, this all constraint bother me then.
