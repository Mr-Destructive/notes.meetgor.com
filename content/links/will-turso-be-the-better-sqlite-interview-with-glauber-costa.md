# Will Turso be the better SQLite? Interview with Glauber Costa

**Link:** https://youtu.be/1JHOY0zqNBY

## Context

This was a great interview. I love the mentality. If software built with community in the Linux community can sustain after almost 3 decades, then why can’t a embedded database like SQLite can? Turso is Linux Community but for SQLite (minus the toxic leadership) Pekka is a great, humble and smart leader to be leading the Turso, SQLite rewrite in Rust. I want to contribute to SQLite, but it feels I don’t know enough everytime I touch it, also I started learning SQL for this. I have gone so far and now there is no way I am turning back. I had one itch for geospatial exploration in SQLite for Mumbai city. This weekend might be the time to do it, maybe next year.
