## Context

3. [Will Turso be the better SQLite? Interview with Glauber Costa](https://youtu.be/1JHOY0zqNBY)
    1. This was a great interview. I love the mentality.
    2. If software built with community in the Linux community can sustain after almost 3 decades, then why can’t a embedded database like SQLite can?
    3. Turso is Linux Community but for SQLite (minus the toxic leadership)
    4. Pekka is a great, humble and smart leader to be leading the Turso, SQLite rewrite in Rust.
    5. I want to contribute to SQLite, but it feels I don’t know enough everytime I touch it, also I started learning SQL for this. I have gone so far and now there is no way I am turning back.
    6. I had one itch for geospatial exploration in SQLite for Mumbai city. This weekend might be the time to do it, maybe next year.
