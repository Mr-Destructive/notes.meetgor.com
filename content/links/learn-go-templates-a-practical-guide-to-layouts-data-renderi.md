# Learn Go Templates: A practical guide to layouts, data rendering in Golang

## Context

It was a great article. It covered a lot of things in detail as well as digestible examples. I liked the explanation of template partials and functions. I might be using them in my ssg in Golang (burrow). There was one missing nuance, that is using a variable if inside a loop range and referencing with the $ to access the outer variables in templates.
