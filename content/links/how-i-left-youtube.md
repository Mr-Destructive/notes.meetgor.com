# How I left youtube

## Context

Man that was a good read! I resonated with this a lot This duality is exhausting. It forces you to lie by omission to people you respect. You can’t tell your team, “I can’t take that ticket because I need to study dynamic programming.” You just have to work faster. I respect people above and behind me, but I too needed to move in life, support the things I was responsible for, get out of the grave situation I was pushed into. For that, I took some decisions, which I tried for, but nothing came off it, I wasn’t quite sure about the switch and left it when the offer came. Stranded here. I am feeling good here, but if I am not in another company by the end of 2026, something is wrong with me. Let’s see! Good lessons Don’t say: “I tweaked the YouTube watch-time algorithm using X variable. ” Do say: “I optimized a high-throughput distributed system to prioritize user retention metrics, reducing latency by 150ms through a custom caching layer.” Man!! My final conversation with my manager was heart-wrenching. I had prepared a script, anticipating a counter-offer or a guilt trip. Instead, I was met with soft and understanding empathy.  Yep The interview fatigue is real, and the conversations are hard, but the clarity you gain on your own value is worth the struggle. Got to go through it once and then there would be no stop for growth. Grass looks green on the other side always! Damm
