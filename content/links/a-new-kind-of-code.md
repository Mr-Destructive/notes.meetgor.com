# A New kind of Code

## Context

I like the analogy of glue code, but I don’t like reviewing code. Its skill issue on my side, yes, but I can’t stand reading code, I want to see it, I want to feel it. Generating with a button doesn’t give me any excitement to push forward to get things done. Maybe I am naive, but I don’t like that button. Sometimes yes I do use it, sometimes forced to, but I like to keep nuts and bolt and prepare it myself. I am learning still maybe that is the reason. Can’t disagree to Thorsten, who can write 2 books about crafting programming languages and interpreters and compilers.
