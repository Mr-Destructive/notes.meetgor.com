# I can’t recommend Grafana to everyone

## Context

Change is the fundamental in software, if something out there exist, it might not tomorrow, there is no gurantee, even if someone says so, might not. There are rare gems like SQLite, cURL, linux kernel and some of the fundamental tools that just work and don’t change or won’t change because that is what they do are supposed to do. No more no less, more they are adding, but it might come at the cost of backwards compatibility.
