## Context

1. [The modern job hunt: Part 1](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-modern-job-hunt-part-1)
    - This was a heart warming and hope-giving post. For a person struggling with jobs, finding a new hope is something that this post absolutely gave in abundance.
    - The comparison of a walk to garbage collection is so funny. Job search as a searching algorithm.
    - I also like the two different contrasting thoughts and way of thinking about the situation, from
      > *This job search is a hopeless, unending slog!*TO*Yes, this will end. Everything ends.*
    - This hits home. Truly a great post, Eagerly awaiting for a second part. Subscribed to the RSS feed only to know the feed isn’t updated.
