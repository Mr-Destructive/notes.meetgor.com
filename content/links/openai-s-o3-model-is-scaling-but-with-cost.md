## Context

[OpenAI’s o3 model is scaling but with cost](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/openais-o3-suggests-ai-models-are-scaling-in-new-ways-but-so-are-the-costs/) (maybe not with performance XD): This is a huge cost, just compare it with the normal 4o or Haiku, it is a gazillion times much better.
