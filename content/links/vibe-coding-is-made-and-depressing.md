# Vibe Coding is made and depressing

**Link:** https://law.gmnz.xyz/vibe-coding-is-mad-depressing/

## Context

Sigh, The frustration is quite evident > I just feel sad with how AI has bastardized my profession, which I worked hard for the last 15 years. There is no best practices anymore, no proper process, no meaningful back and forth I can even feel it with 5 years of coding, man has been doing it for 15 years! Humans gets too excited when they can produce code i think.
