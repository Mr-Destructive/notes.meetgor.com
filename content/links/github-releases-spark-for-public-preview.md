## Context

[Qwen-3 Coder](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/): It seems we have now a whole bunch of terminal based ai code war. Claude Code, Codex (does anyone use it?), Warp, Ampcode, Gemini CLI, now Qwen.
- [Google is testing an vibe coding app called Opal](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/google-is-testing-a-vibe-coding-app-called-opal/): Another one. We have no shortage of these, Firebase Studio, Lovable, V0, Bolt, and what nots.

I’ll leave you here, it’s been a great week atleast on the learning side, should be more fun next week and over the weekend.
