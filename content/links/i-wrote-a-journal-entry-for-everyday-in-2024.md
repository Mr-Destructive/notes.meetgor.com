# I wrote a journal entry for everyday in 2024

**Link:** https://www.njbrown.com/blog/67/

## Context

I had journaled for 1 year in paper, 2 years on my phone, and the last couple of years, have lost that habit. Life gets in the way, your habits change, but this I think I have to keep, it used to give me clarity and feeling of accomplishment. It has been exactly a month since I started journalling again, pen and paper, a tiny little book, around 50 words, I would cramp 100 in that little page. I love it, its like a glimpse of a quarter in a tiny book. I am also thinking of getting back to obsidian for digital journal, just because its accessible and searchable. This article I will give credit for bringing up searching and doing some analysis on the things I have already written, that would be exciting to find how I change or my writing changes me.
