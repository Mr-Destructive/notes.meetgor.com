## Context

Speed is useless without direction. We all can agree to that. Having a dumb engineer with claude code is -10x efficient then having gemini cli to a real soy dev. [AI is Dunning-Kruger as a Service](https://christianheilmann.com/2025/10/30/ai-is-dunning-kruger-as-a-service/)- Agreed. This is the opposite of imposter syndrome. It hits like ego. You think, that you have done the job without thinking. We are at such a conjecture that we are trying to feel like done something without doing it. AI-art for instance, if you put it on your thumbnail or post it, what are you really doing, pretending that you made it? Having the feel of creating something without creating it?
