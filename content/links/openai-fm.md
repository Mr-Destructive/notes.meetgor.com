# openai.fm

**Link:** http://openai.fm/

## Context

* [Open AI releases new Audio Text to Speech API playground](https://openai.com/index/introducing-our-next-generation-audio-models/) → [openai.fm](openai.fm)
    * This looks good, really good, podcasts, videos are a bit risky at voice now. Clearly, voice is taking over with AI, text > images > voice > ??? This is going big.
