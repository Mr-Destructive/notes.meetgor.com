## Context

- [Thinking/Planning vs Building](https://youtu.be/rosMfs3pZ_0?si=z7NM3q_xRIHYe0Ek): This was a cool video, I was always with hands-on approach when it comes to developing anything. However since the last year, having the company of my manager, I got into the habit of thinking and sketching out the plan for the implementation, maybe that is different, we don’t create a document, we just brainstorm on the idea. Making the logic clear.  
  I also like the direct code implementation, to get a taste of what works and what is the actual problem to solve than to guess and later realise the problem was to pick stones than to carve the stone.Double click to interact with video
