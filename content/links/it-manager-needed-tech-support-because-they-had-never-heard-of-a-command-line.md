## Context

Can we all laugh here? I mean, yes its not needed, but at least heard of it! SKILL ISSUES. Or Maybe he was rich, he had macbook since his career began. I didn't had a laptop, I found the command line on my android phone! Also discovered the world of Vim, because Nano and Vim was the only option, and I choose the Command line and Vim came along.
