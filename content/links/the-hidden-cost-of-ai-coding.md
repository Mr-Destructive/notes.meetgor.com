## Context

- [The hidden cost of AI coding](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/04/23/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-coding/?ref=dailydev)
    - With AI and Agentic AI, we as developers are going to get very few flow state sessions. Since we will not be writing any code, we will be just guiding like a pilot, and the actual craft is up to LLM to do, which is scary and takes the fun out of the art.
    - I am really upset and feeling empty after realising this. Also, there have been discussions around me where the takeover of AI by developers was around the corner. Not even that, I am not scared of that, but the part right now, where companies and top-level managers, or whatever they are called, are forcing developers to use LLMs. They say, Why use horse carts when we have flying jets. As if decades old tradition of writing software was wiped out in months.
    - Really, it feels sad to be living in this revolution. It’s exciting at some point, agreed. But the more I use it, the more I fear.
    - I really don’t feel that there will be such periods created for developers by most companies, since they only see money as output.
