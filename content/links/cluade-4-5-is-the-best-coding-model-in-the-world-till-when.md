## Context

- [Cluade 4.5 is the best coding model in the world? Till when](https://youtu.be/uZBjVeyiYkk)
    - Claude 4.5 dropped, maybe its a 0.5x improvement, is it? Maybe but definitely it has reduced its behaviour. That is a good and a bad change.
    - Good because obviously, it should work in friendly way, AI and security right now are two separate circles, bubbles if you will.
    - Bad because now we it doesn’t quite do what it is asked to do, it might avoid the things that are not ethical, but it could have side-effects where it could reject a query which is genuine and not align with its interpretation of ethical.
