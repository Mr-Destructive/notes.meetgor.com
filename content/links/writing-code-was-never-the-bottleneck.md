## Context

6. [Writing code was never the bottleneck](https://ordep.dev/posts/writing-code-was-never-the-bottleneck)
    - Yes, code was never the bottleneck, but it was not also the easiest thing. People plan and plan, and plan more, but the execution is not up the mark, and the planning was of no use. Coding is neglected among managers but empathy is needed to bridge the gap.
