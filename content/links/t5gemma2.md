## Context

This is a 270 M, 1B and 4B parameter with multimodal and mulitlingual capabilities, it has a long context of 128K.
            
        * This again stands a good balance from lightweight to intelligence ratio, highly a good candidate for making people transition into full on AI systems. I don't know if it would lead to good or bad outcomes but a good step from Google.
