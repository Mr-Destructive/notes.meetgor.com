# T5Gemma2

## Context

* Google Releases
    
    * [Gemini 3 Flash](https://blog.google/technology/developers/build-with-gemini-3-flash/)
        
        * A good jump, the preview model hmm, from the tests I have done on OCR, it struggled from teh 2.5 Flash. Maybe let's wait to make it stable.
            
    * [Function Gemma](https://blog.google/technology/developers/functiongemma/)
        
        * A 270 Million parameter fine-tuned model especially for function calling and following instructions
            
        * This looks really promising, can't wait to build something on the phone or the cloud with it.
            
    * [T5Gemma2](https://blog.google/technology/developers/t5gemma-2/)
        
        * This is a 270 M, 1B and 4B parameter with multimodal and mulitlingual capabilities, it has a long context of 128K.
            
        * This again stands a good balance from lightweight to intelligence ratio, highly a good candidate for making people transition into full on AI systems. I don't know if it would lead to good or bad outcomes but a good step from Google.
