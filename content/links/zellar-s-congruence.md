# Zellar’s congruence

## Context

I haven’t watched anything this week that is worth sharing and technical enough. I have replaced my youtube watching time with 1 hour writing sprints. For the past whole week, I wrote around 9k words. I had a goal and I am moving towards it. I don’t know if youtube is worth watching anymore. I’ll enjoy other things while I can. ## Learnt Flask has a [after_request](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#flask.Flask.after_request) decorator/hook, that we can use to run at the end of a request.- I added it to log a request, created a state and appended/put to the state after a even happening at any part of the API. Then using that state, I dumped it in a log, that gave a reliable and a singular data point to gather and analysis data. A good pattern to remember and learn from. [Zellar’s congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence) algorithm to calculate the weekday from a given date- This was a problem of the day in the freecodecamp daily challenge. I love it, it helped me learn this algorithm. Its so trivial to implement yet feels so useful to get weekday of any given date. Leave the timezone mess aside for a moment.
