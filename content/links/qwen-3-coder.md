**Link:** https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/

## Context

[GitHub releases Spark for public preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-23-github-spark-in-public-preview-for-copilot-pro-subscribers/): This looks solid and well engineered product, will be trying out this weekend, finger crossed, will get time and will be streaming it.
- [Google is testing an vibe coding app called Opal](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/google-is-testing-a-vibe-coding-app-called-opal/): Another one. We have no shortage of these, Firebase Studio, Lovable, V0, Bolt, and what nots.

I’ll leave you here, it’s been a great week atleast on the learning side, should be more fun next week and over the weekend.
