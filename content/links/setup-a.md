# Setup a

## Context

[Setup a](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/docs/DOCKER.md) `sqld` [server with docker](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/docs/DOCKER.md): I was checking out SQLD, a server daemon for LibSQL, a SQLite fork database. This is really handy for connecting a sqlite-like database over the network. I am using docker for running it locally and it is a breeze to set it up.
