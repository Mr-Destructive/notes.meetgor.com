# The Fires of Heaven

## Context

Such a great quote to describe my situation right now. I am just bowing down, accepting the flaws but not the things that were not mine. Just letting go of things, and let life show its wrath or the good behind the bad its happening. Because I can confidently say, every storm ends with a new beginning and there are definitely some things that flourish after the storm but some do get weathered out due to resistance.
