## Context

Peoples 2024 review posts - [Aron Francis’ 2024 year in review](https://aaronfrancis.com/2024/year-in-review-2024-ebfbb78c) This is the man I admire, and wow he has done quite a bit to make quite an impact on developers, the courses are soo valuable, the articles are soo motivating, as humble as he gets. - [Haimantika Mitras: Wrapping up 2024](https://newsletter.haimantika.com/p/wrapping-up-2024) It’s a bit hard to face situations like hers in the festive month. It feels a bit disturbing and yet she came out with flying colors and kept the enthusiasm on, a lot of inspiration to draw from. - [Florencia Luz Duarte’s: Goodbye 2024](https://unicornio.dev/en/blog/bye-2024/) THe story felt a bit similar to mine, landing a full-time job after a hunt. It feels good to be in those shoes. It might be hard, but I am emphatic about it, as I know the feelings of rejection after you worked hard. Also the nice little tidbits like having 24 hours in a day, we can do only a few things, needn’t do all the things is a reminder to ease out and take things one by one.
