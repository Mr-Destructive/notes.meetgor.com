# Exploring EXIF

## Context

A great post, diving into a specific tool for a lot of things.
    - I think the media metadata is messed up, the software is not consistently adhering to the standards. Look at the blog post and the Apple photos have a lot more metadata then Google or any other photo taking software.
    - I have to say the different of fields are in orders of magnitude more than the rest. How much additional info they cram into a single photo is bewildering.
    - I really liked the post, it had dumping of data into sqlite database and writing queries to get certain things, how cute and interesting that idea is. My brain is running in all directions at this now.
    - LLMs to write queries to get photos from albums with natural language and metadata without actually processing the image, is one I can hit straight off my head.
    - I confirmed that it Apple who is pouring love into those photos. It probably has to do a lot of things in the background to get the metadata. Such a irony of tech today. Lagging behind the trend but way ahead of everyone in the core.
