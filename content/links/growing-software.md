# Growing Software

**Link:** https://www.pearprogramming.blog/programming/opinions/2025/11/11/why-rails-just-stayed-with-me/

## Context

1. What a great analogy. Software is not architect a building but its growing a garden. You don’t have a layout already built, some parts are clear not all. Software is ever changing. You need to build something, observe and change constantly just like a gardener. Gardener doesn’t plant a bunch of plants and forgets, but rather it nurtures them, observes and then takes care of them.
    2. Software is not something you build, its something you grow. Its a slow process.
