## Context

[Building Effective Agents (Anthropic Blog)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents): This is a great overview of LLM Agents, different types of Agents and how is the landscape of AI Agents is changing due to LLM. It’s not changing technically, but how simple concepts from AI are striking again like a revival. I remember learning about it in my bachelor’s degree classes, agents as some program that acts according to the conditions and interaction with the environment, I can relate it so well and sticks to me due to that.
