# Meta releases open weight coding model

**Link:** https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/cwm-an-open-weights-llm-for-research-on-code-generation-with-world-models/

## Context

This is a bit cool, it has almost the intelligence of Gemini 2.5 Thinking with a lot less parameters (32 B)
    - It also has a different and quite novel approach for a coding model

That’s it from this week. It has been a harsher week. We are finally into the last quarter of 2025. Ah! That ended pretty quickly. LLMs have just consumed me.
