# Yes you are screwed

**Link:** https://ghuntley.com/screwed/

## Context

I am here for the hot takes, I read this article last week and shared some thoughts I was completely agreed to the article as I am not sure about certain things, I lack some common sense I think, but yes THE PRIMEAGEN in GOD mode opened my eyes
    * If you are with people who are working for money, is usually good according to their experiences, which is fair, it sometimes it depends on the interaction with the person rather than the nature of the person. We sometimes get used to the nature of the person after some time.
    * Use LLM but understand what are you doing exactly
    * Copilot was great bump in the productivity of developers when it launched but since now we are used to the generated code, it seems like we get bad completion or it’s bad.
    * A good analogy for LLM's ability to code, the more precise you want to do certain thing, the better the generation is, and the broader the scope of the task, it messes up. Like give me the next 2 lines of code in the current position, that is good, LLM is really good at that (not always). But if you give i want to build this project, in an x and y way with a and b technology, that is where it might get a little screwed (Devin not mentioned but I heard the screams)
    * AI SaaS clones are shit and not true things, it is more than code, relation, care the bond. If someone is earning money for the SaaS clone they build with AI, then they might be building a silly problem for a silly user.
    * The point of juniors is that in the future they will pay off the investment they made.
    * That was too much maybe, a reaction of a reaction, no it’s a note for me.
2.  [Backend Banter with Mitchell Hashimoto](https://youtu.be/586_BAMMOQ8):
    * I have watched it halfway through and so far some hot takes
    * Rust ecosystem is a little messed up to interact with for him at least
    * Zig fixes the pains of C, the build ecosystem (handles the compilation for us), and package management (like go)
    * Project-based learning for the win!!
    * He started to build Ghostty as a fun toy project, then found some pain points and tried to fix those with an ecosystem of libraries to build an  abstraction layer of apps on top of terminal emulation.
