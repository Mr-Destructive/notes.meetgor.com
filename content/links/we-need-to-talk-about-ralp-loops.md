# We need to talk about Ralp loops

## Context

It kind of is hillarious of how this works! I am not able to wrap my head around it. Like why and how What kind of ... Writing it immediately hit me. I do the same thing that Ralph loop does with AMP code free tier. The context size is limited, so I have to be wary of the limit, I keep the summary of the thread once the limit is reached and continue a new thread. Wow. Writing actually makes things visible and find the hidden patterns. Gold! Watching this video now makes sense. It just a loop for agent to start from where it left off without bloating the context. Superb.
