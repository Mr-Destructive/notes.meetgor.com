## Context

- Move out of thinking, start doing stuff it will make things moving and create a flow that is hard to stop.

[Shuffle: Making random feel more human](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/11/shuffle-making-random-feel-more-human?ref=dailydev) - This is a bit under-technical thing. I didn’t get a good flow of the algorithm. i want to understand with an example.

[Rabbit hole learning](https://seated.ro/posts/rabbit-hole-learning.html)- This is a good idea, but it kind of breaks the cycle kf a rabbit hole to log everything that we did and learnt.
