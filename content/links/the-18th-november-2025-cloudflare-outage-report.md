# The 18th November 2025 Cloudflare Outage Report

## Context

Ok, that was quite a big outage. It was the biggest Cloudflare outage since 2019. Four hours. It was down, everything was down. It got a few eyes on the engineering debt. I wonder if Cloudflare was really required in their tech stack who were affected in this outage. Really? I don’t think so, just for reverse-proxy, verification, 10 users, do you need Cloudflare? No, dog, you don’t. This is what is rightly pointed out [here](https://gist.github.com/jbreckmckye/32587f2907e473dd06d68b0362fb0048) . It was a good thing, it put eyes on things which we take for granted or overlook, and just use the defaults, the frictionless tools.
