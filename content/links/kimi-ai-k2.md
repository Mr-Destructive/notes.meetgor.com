## Context

- [Kimi AI K2](https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/): This is probably the largest open weights model out in the wild, and that too probably the first that is really beating the state of the art models in tool calling and agentic coding. A huge standard leveller for open source community. There are quirks about the license but its pretty commendable in terms of what they have achieved.
