# Kimi AI K2

**Link:** https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/

## Context

[Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/): Amazon out of thin air just blew this up. Its almost like Cursor but with more controlled and flexible using preferences. It almost forces developers to plan and thoroughly consider the most tedious and boring part (sometimes the most exciting) of the development which is defining the problem and listing the features.
- [Cognition acquires Windsurf](https://cognition.ai/blog/windsurf): Devin will now use Windsurf, interesting deal this. How on earth are these two even partnering, doesn’t makes sense. At one point it looked they are rivals, even opposite mentality, but somehow they are collaborating now.
- [ChatGPT releases Agents](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/): This is like a thing that we all knew was coming but is late on the tables. Need to check it out if that is available for free users or not. If yes, then will be quite a fun thing to do and learn.
