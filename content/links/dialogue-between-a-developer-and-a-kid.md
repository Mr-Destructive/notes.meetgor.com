# Dialogue between a developer and a kid

**Link:** https://riggraz.dev/dialogue-developer.html

## Context

This is hilariously funny. What a real developer is? Who knows languages? No, who knows how to code, No! A developer is someone who sticks to a problem when everyone has given up. This conversation feels like me and my friend. My friend is the reason I am here today. He knew programming well. I was inspired from him, he gave me advice to learn one programming language, I was boasting about python, C and C++. I feel like a kid here. That was 7 years ago, time flies by.
