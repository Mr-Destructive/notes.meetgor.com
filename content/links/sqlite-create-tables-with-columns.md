# SQLite: Create Tables with columns

## Context

SQLOG Entries for 7th September to 12th September Continuing with some week of Learning SQL probably 8, but 24 days of consistently writing a blog post. Feels refreshing and accomplished. It really feels good to look at the number cracking up and the blog filling up, the sudden increase in likes, followers and sprinkles of curiosity to learn more. Writing about the things we learn is underrated.
