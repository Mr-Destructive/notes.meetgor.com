# Don’t become the machine

## Context

This is well put. I kind of hate this argument. Why are we comparing ourselves to machines in the first place? We can grind, but with thinking what actually we are doing. Because I equate grind to consistency, it sometimes feels like grind, and we need to overcome that emotion of letting it overtake us. But most of the days, the grind is a joy, we do it because we feel like doing it.
