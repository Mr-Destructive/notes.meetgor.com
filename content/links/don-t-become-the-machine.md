# Don’t become the machine

**Link:** https://armeet.bearblog.dev/becoming-the-machine/

## Context

2. [Don’t become the machine](https://armeet.bearblog.dev/becoming-the-machine/)
    1. This is well put.
    2. I kind of hate this argument.
    3. Why are we comparing ourselves to machines in the first place? We can grind, but with thinking what actually we are doing.
    4. Because I equate grind to consistency, it sometimes feels like grind, and we need to overcome that emotion of letting it overtake us. But most of the days, the grind is a joy, we do it because we feel like doing it.
