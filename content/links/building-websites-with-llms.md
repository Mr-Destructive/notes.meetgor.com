## Context

- [Building Websites with LLMs](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/lots-of-little-html-pages): This was a really a nice post, need to add this to my blog as well. I want to write more and the more I write I will create more sections like TILs, Thoughts, Link Blog, Articles, Series, Tags, and we can go on, I want to keep my existing site simple yet, I want to organise them in a susinct way.
