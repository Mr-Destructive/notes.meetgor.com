# Computerphile: Machine Code Explained

**Link:** https://youtu.be/8VsiYWW9r48

## Context

I haven’t seen such a simple explanation of Assembly Code and Memory in my life. The comparison of register as memory blocks, pigeon holes as memory units holding volatile memory. I want to read [this book](https://yurichev.com/mirrors/machine-code-for-beginners.pdf) . This is such a great visual of how memory and computers work. I think in the age of AI, shallow knowledge is no good, we need depth and low-level details, when vibe code slop fails, real grug brain developer has to roll off his sleeves and dug deeper.
