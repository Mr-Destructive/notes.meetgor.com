# sum of squares and squares of sum problem in Exercism SQLite track

## Context

SQL’s IIF is equivalent for CASE WHEN THEN
          - The IIF is like an handy if else block to use when having nested conditions.
          - This works and looks neat for smaller expressions, like one or two condition max, after that its better to use CASE
          - The syntax looks something like:
            ```
            SELECT IIF(something > 10, "YES", "NO") as answer FROM somewhere;
            ```
