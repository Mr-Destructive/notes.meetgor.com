# An illustrated guide to OAUTH 2

## Context

This made everything click, not quite everything. I want a better example. I will write a post where I would relate it to a much more simpler and broader example. The Chase bank and other finance provider is a bit not known to me, I want to make the example clear.
    - But really the explanations in this blog are really sketched out and make a lot of sense.
