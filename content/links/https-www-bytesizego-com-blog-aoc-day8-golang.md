## Context

Advent of Code day 8 after implementing myself, I decided to take a look at others’ solutions: [https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/aoc-day8-golang This](https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/aoc-day8-golang￼This) was an easy problem from the implementation perspective I did it in a few minutes, to be honest, but understanding it was tough, so I left the explaining to others. This post shows courage and willingness to go in the wild, show your approach and do it skillfully, truly an inspiration to write and complete Blogvent (I am running a week behind already :))
