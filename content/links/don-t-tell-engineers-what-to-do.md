# Don’t tell engineers what to do?

**Link:** https://code.dblock.org/2025/07/30/dont-tell-engineers-what-to-do.html

## Context

2. [Don’t tell engineers what to do?](https://code.dblock.org/2025/07/30/dont-tell-engineers-what-to-do.html)
    1. This post, hits me and in a good way. It basically helped me get out of the self constrained mindset that I was doing wrong, instead I think I am doing my job. That is to listen and implement, the moment I raised objections or pointed out a few things, I was turned down as a kid on a shop. I am not embarrassed about it, just that the mindset in which I am working might be a little old or startupy. I am not saying I am perfect, just that there is a way to address engineers and their concerns.
    2. Everything in the post that has been said, is totally relatable and worth reading for me. I read and felt a deep satisfaction that I might be just right and move on with the things.
