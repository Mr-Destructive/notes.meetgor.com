# MCP: A protocol to watch

**Link:** https://ashley.dev/posts/mcp-a-protocol-to-watch/

## Context

- [MCP: A protocol to watch](https://ashley.dev/posts/mcp-a-protocol-to-watch/)
    - I also get what MCP is for, I actually created the tool-calling extension for Meta AI’s API, which was a chat interface only. I saw the pain points and really found the need to standardizing the way we create, pass, and retrieve functions to LLMs.
    - MCP is the protocol to do that, not just function/tool calling, it is also important for tool-specific context passing.
    - But yes, the concrete ways to use this haven’t clicked with me yet. I have a few ideas, but not finding the motivation enough to build it end-to-end.
