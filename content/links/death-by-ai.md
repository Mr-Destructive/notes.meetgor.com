## Context

Woah! AI Overview mode in Google is terse at certain things. But for programming, I think it works a charm 95% of the times. yes there are pretty bad hallucinations too due to reddit and slop debates.
    - Haven’t thought that it would mistaken a person with other person’s name and call it dead! Hillarious.
