## Context

Great article, it shows the author cares about his craft, I can relate to the feeling of learning a lot of things.
    - Doing things faster can lead to cutting corners, that’s a good take. I think we can agree to that, we are loosing the ability to know something deeper. Learning is becoming easy, but not deeper, its shallow, brittle and hallucinated. Failure-based learning is more valuable then productive driven success.
