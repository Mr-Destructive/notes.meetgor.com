## Context

3. [I still care about the code](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/i-still-care-about-the-code.html)
    - This is so well put, LLMs are not compilers or interpreters, they still are unreliable. I mean ~~software is unreliable~~, **untested software is unreliable** but LLM generated code is on the extreme end of black holes.
    - Hallucination is a things, I am not talking about on-surface wrong things, I am talking about deep and little details, that right now only human developers can craft.
