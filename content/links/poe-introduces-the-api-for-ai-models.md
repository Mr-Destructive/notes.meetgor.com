# POE introduces the API for AI Models

**Link:** https://poe.com/blog/introducing-the-poe-api

## Context

- [POE introduces the API for AI Models](https://poe.com/blog/introducing-the-poe-api)
    - I have used POE in the past, and this looks like a great addition to test out a few SOTA models for free with some limitations via the API.

Phew! a lot of open source models are cooking! Everything is intuition and curiosity, and AI is still a thing to wrap our heads around, but the fundamentals are the same.

See you in the next one!

Happy Coding :)
