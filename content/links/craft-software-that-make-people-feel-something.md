## Context

1. [Craft Software that make people feel something](https://rapha.land/craft-software-that-makes-people-feel-something/)
    1. So good. Just do it because there is a curiosity. Inspiration is also cool and need for software to make.  
      > When programming becomes repetitive, the odds of you creating something that makes people go “wow” are reduced quite a bit. It isn’t a rule, of course. You need to be inspired to make inspiring software.
    2. This is aspiration, the level of it is high here.  
      > This is what I’m talking about: taking time to build something so that once people try it, they remember it for as long as they live.
