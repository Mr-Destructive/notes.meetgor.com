# Craft Software that make people feel something

**Link:** https://rapha.land/craft-software-that-makes-people-feel-something/

## Context

So good. Just do it because there is a curiosity. Inspiration is also cool and need for software to make. > When programming becomes repetitive, the odds of you creating something that makes people go “wow” are reduced quite a bit. It isn’t a rule, of course. You need to be inspired to make inspiring software. This is aspiration, the level of it is high here. > This is what I’m talking about: taking time to build something so that once people try it, they remember it for as long as they live.
