## Context

[Ghostty Terminal Released](https://ghostty.org/): This is something to try out on the next weekend. This is the terminal emulator created by the [author](https://mitchellh.com/) of Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Vagrant, etc. and he has co-founded Hashicorp, so something serious cooking here. For more news, follow the [Hackernewsletter](https://buttondown.com/hacker-newsletter/archive/hacker-newsletter-726) and for software development/coding articles, join [daily.dev](http://daily.dev/) . Sadly the Hackernews newsletter edition #727 has not yet dropped in, maybe its the holiday season so a off week for them. That’s it from this 22 edition of my weekly learning, hope you enjoyed it, and leave comments on what you think about some of my takes or any feedback. [REMOVED] Thank you for Reading.
