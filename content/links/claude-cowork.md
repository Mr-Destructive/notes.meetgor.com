## Context

Again, I was tempted to learn how different people perceive this tool. I never watched her videos. But this video came to me at random and I thought of watching it, it was fun. It also showed a good starting point and a legit use cases for people to curse themselves a little less with such tools. Developers can do it with writing scripts but laymen can’t oooohhh. This tool should just do that.
