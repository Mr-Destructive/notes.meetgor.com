# You have to feel it

**Link:** https://mitchellh.com/writing/feel-it

## Context

Feel it, Just completing tasks, merging PRs, lists of metrics improved won’t help, if you don’t feel it.
    - Just creating for the completion is fine, sometimes needed, if you haven’t gone through the whole feeling, but not always, you need the drive to complete it in a sustainable way.
