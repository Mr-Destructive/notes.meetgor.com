# HackerNews Newsletter

**Link:** https://mailchi.mp/hackernewsletter/710

## Context

* [AI Studio](https://ai.meta.com/ai-studio/): Create fictional AI characters to chat with by Meta. This is pretty good use case for authors and fantasy writers. It could allow them to get to know their characters in a better way.
    

As always, I recommend going through the [HackerNews Newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/hackernewsletter/710) to get all the tech news.

That’s it from this week, hope you did well this week, and have a happy week and weekend ahead!

Thank you for reading, let’s catch up in the next week.

Happy Coding :)
