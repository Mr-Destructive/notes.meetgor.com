## Context

Top to down approach. This just shifts from taking the problem and boiling it down to the input and output. Wow! This just made so much sense now. We can define the main API as the function that takes something and returns something. In between the intermediate steps, we can then decide what each component of the result will come from. I need to try hard on learning functional programming this year.
