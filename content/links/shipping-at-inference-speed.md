# Shipping at inference speed

**Link:** https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed

## Context

This is a good post to say that we have different ways of using LLMs at this point and nothing is permanent. Every month or weeks, this is changing. Adopting a new workflow is like juggling circus art. Codex is something I haven’t even touched, Claude code too, never. I have used Amp, Gemini CLI, Warp and Cursor the most. I love those, those are cheap or even free, they help me understand what I was about to do wrong. They have never produced anything right 100%. I always needed to understand what was I supposed to do. Is this true “>The important decisions these days are language/ecosystem and dependencies” Maybe but I don’t see that. Its kind of true, but not in a big way. The major things are the flow, the edge cases and the intuition for the problem for it to be ale to understand. This actually surprised me”> Go wasn’t something I gave even the slightest thought even a few months ago, but eventually I played around and found that agents are really great at writing it, and its simple type system makes linting fast.” I want to try it now. I have ton of go projects.
