# Feedback is not attack

**Link:** https://ashley.dev/posts/feedback-is-not-an-attack/

## Context

1. [The art of saying no](https://duncan.dev/post/art-of-saying-no): This post is so accurate in describing the feeling while doing AI assisted development. We have to constantly sift through hundreds of suggestions or ideas to get the one that we are looking for, and that is not easy and comforting at first. However, just like debugging intuitively, accepting suggestions and vibing would become a intuition based activity, it just takes a few misses and hits, some trials and explorations of how these LLMs work.
2. [Never Just](https://www.neverjust.net/): This is absolutely relatable, when we are in complex problem solving situation, and someone says “why don’t we just make it simple”. The person saying this either doesn’t know the problem or knows too much that he simply can do it instead of asking it to others. If this just comes from the surface, it feels a bit hurting, it should be reframed to make it more informative and actionable instead of attacking.
3. [A Linear Algebra Trick for computing Fibonacci Numbers Fast](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/a-linear-algebra-trick-for-fibonacci-numbers): An interesting way to compute Fibonacci numbers. A nice matrix multiplication trick.
4. [A tale of two Claudes](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-claudes/): A completely honest and realistic take.
    1. Claude cannot work with Tailwind 4
    2. Claude works well with compiler and gnarly debugging memory related issues
    3. This is really cool to be aware of, we can use LLMs to guide us in the situations when we are not sure. Because it will speed things up and probably reach conclusions much faster and we can then decide if that conclusion was right or not, rather than spending hours in the gnarly bugs.
    4. Someone said it, LLMs are thinking too fast, so we should think slow, what a perfect sentence.
6. [What would Kubernetes 2.0 be like](https://matduggan.com/what-would-a-kubernetes-2-0-look-like/): YAML should be replaced with HCL, that is a golden point. No like seriously, reading a long yaml file just gives me headache. I prefer JSON Instead. Also the helm package manager is written in Golang, I want to dive deeper into K8s.
7. [This AI Agent should have been a SQL Query](https://www.morling.dev/blog/this-ai-agent-should-have-been-sql-query/): This one was more like Apache Flink comparison and walkthrough, maybe as a example but it was good.
