# Visual Studio Code + Copilot is not open source

**Link:** https://youtu.be/7Lf0jEgz9BA

## Context

VS Code is trying to save tools like cline and augment code
    - Basically, making developers stick to the VS Code ecosystem as closely as possible
    - This will make that happen, with Copilot abilities (not the server), access to make the abilities run within VS Code, so people don’t have to fork it.
