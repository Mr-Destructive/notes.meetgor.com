# Never Just

## Context

2. [Never Just](https://www.neverjust.net/): This is absolutely relatable, when we are in complex problem solving situation, and someone says “why don’t we just make it simple”. The person saying this either doesn’t know the problem or knows too much that he simply can do it instead of asking it to others. If this just comes from the surface, it feels a bit hurting, it should be reframed to make it more informative and actionable instead of attacking.
