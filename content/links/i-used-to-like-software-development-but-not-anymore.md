# I used to like software development, but not anymore

## Context

- But no one can take the task as happily (or readily)as developers because we are driven by the hunger of understanding, the curiousity that kindles and fires the rest of the way through the solution, no one can easily outsource it.

[I used to like software development, but not anymore](https://blog.kulman.sk/i-used-to-like-software-development-but-not-anymore/)- Nostalgia, I remember I started my programming journey, installing Codeblocks and PyCharm. That was some heck of a task, but the satisfaction of following bucky roberts tutorials and able to understand the stuff, was pure joy.
