# I used to like software development, but not anymore

## Context

Nostalgia, I remember I started my programming journey, installing Codeblocks and PyCharm. That was some heck of a task, but the satisfaction of following bucky roberts tutorials and able to understand the stuff, was pure joy. Nowadays who needs to understand the variables, no LLM just takes care of it. The depth, the pain of uncomfortable is lost. The joy of finding stackoverflow question is lost. Its not just AI or LLMs, but people are just working a bit wired, the mindset, the systems have kind of outgrown humans to productivity myths and its rotting thier brain.
