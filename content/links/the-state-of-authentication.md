# The State of Authentication

**Link:** https://youtu.be/lxslnp-ZEMw?si=NHEnmYD5AVQUHOM0

## Context

- [The State of Authentication](https://youtu.be/lxslnp-ZEMw?si=NHEnmYD5AVQUHOM0)
    - This is so messed up. There are actually three parts in Authentication. I thought Authentication and Authorization, that’s it
    - Authentication is basically “Am I who I say I am?”
    - Authorisation is what I am allowed to do (if i am who I say I am)\
    - Now the third part of Authentication
    - Auth UI: Lo behold, UIs are not my thing, and yes Auth0 and some other probably some other services too.
