## Context

- [Interview with Varun Mohan, Co-founder and CEO of Windsurf](https://youtu.be/5Z0RCxDZdrE)
    - An insightful conversation with prompting questions which are quite relevant in today’s tech world
    - He had a weird take on hiring, might be too overstrech employees’ health
          - Until the people are dehydrated, then we only look for help in terms of hiring. That is not a good way to put that, I think, it looks a bit cruel even if he might not mean it.
    - Changing from GPU providers to AI Editor, betting on that is pretty dope.
