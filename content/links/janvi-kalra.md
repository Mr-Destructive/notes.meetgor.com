## Context

- Janvi Kalra From Software Engineer to AI Engineer at OpenAI
  [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://open.substack.com/pub/pragmaticengineer)
    - This was a really inspirational interview. Its giving me hope in continuing what I am doing currently; being excited and willing to develop stuff, doing the due-deligence to research and solve things.
    - I think I now understand my flaw; I am not specific. I am all over the place.
    - She was very specific in boiling down what she was interested in, listing down the 50+ companies in that space, and getting the interviews. It shows the care and love for the craft.
    - I am not sure how to do that, really, because I think I would miss out on certain roles where I might feel excited. I am really a bad problem solver, I don’t know what I should focus on. I think I need to write more in order to nail it down in the coming weeks. Let’s do that and let’s see where it takes me.Double click to interact with video
