# Anatomy of a SQL Engine: Dolthub Blog

**Link:** https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-25-sql-engine-anatomy/

## Context

This was a interesting post. It made me curious how a sql statement query is executed, the ast construction, then right recursive and left recursive. This blog actually made me take a in-depth guide on SQL.
    - I have started reading about SQL and solving leetcode problems and even some problems on SQLBolt. I have even picked up reading “Learning SQL” Book for learning more. I want to get into “Database Internals”, that book is about how under-the-hood sql and databases work, for that I need to learn what SQL is in the first place.
