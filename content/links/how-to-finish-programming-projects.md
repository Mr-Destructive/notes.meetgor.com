## Context

* [How to Finish Programming Projects](https://youtu.be/nqqmwRXSvrw?si=LtLXnr5jPGoQHF6w)?  
    This is a interesting and eye opener video, I initially used to create projects by taking it as a learning opportunity, but gradually the path to creating something big or focusing on the features too much caused a friction and lead to whole lot of issues in the way. One is burnout, the other is no progress at all instead of tiny day-by-day progress.
