## Context

- [ASDF has been re-written in Golang from BASH](https://stratus3d.com/blog/2025/02/03/asdf-has-been-rewritten-in-go/?ref=dailydev): This is nice, I also used to write a lot of bash scripts in my initial novice days, like downloading data, virtual environment management, utilities, etc. but over the years I moved from script kiddie to python and golang scripts, as I have more control and it works for a lot more edge cases then figuring out string parsing on bash.
