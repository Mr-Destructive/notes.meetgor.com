# Beware of the Makefile Effect

## Context

[Beware of the Makefile Effect](https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/01/10/Be-aware-of-the-Makefile-effect): Adding already solved problem to your code is not bad, but randomly yanking and making a saphagetti of the codes surely is a problem. But the counter point to that would be, how to know if the thing we are copying is actually good, that sense need to be developed and I think that comes with time and experience and mistakes.
