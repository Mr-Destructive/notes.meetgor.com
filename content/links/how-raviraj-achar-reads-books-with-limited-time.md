# How Raviraj Achar reads books with limited time

**Link:** https://newsletter.techleadmentor.com/p/how-i-read-books-with-limited-time

## Context

Time is really limited, like everything around you seems to drag into it, the phone most importantly, it feels like a reservoir of knowledge but not wisdom. Taking the time to read is a sign of a level of control over the mind and grit. The process by Raviraj seems a little too complicated or farfetched like Readwise and Notion, those add a lot of friction. I don’t use those tools, I use this newsletter to sift my learnings and tech reading.
