## Context

[https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335455/13-reasons-sql-has-got-to-go.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335455/13-reasons-sql-has-got-to-go.html) I don't like this take, nor I think is grounded. Its looking like a AI slop or maybe someone just living in the land of NoSQL. "Tables don't scale", what is the meaning of it? If that's the case, then collections also don't? Right? I bet PostgreSQL and MySQL aren't using tables, then it means that MySQL doesn't scale, come on! I don't want to react to this clickbait, I already know the pros and cons of SQL vs NoSQL, SQL isn't going anywhere, and so is the good old MySQL. Relational Databases are the nuts and bolts of web, and without them, industry can fall apart pretty quickly. Unless MongoDB keeps them happy :)
