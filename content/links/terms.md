## Context

[How I finally understood Docker and Kubernetes](https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-i-finally-understood-docker-and-kubernetes-5debb13cacfe)
    - This was my pick of the week. I understood the reason why Kubernetes exists
    - I knew the concept of Docker (it could be because I have used it extensively in the past to create projects as well in my internships to deploy APIs and apps)
    - But the concept of Kubernetes is like a black-box. But the author’s explanation style and simple example made it clear.
    - Kubernetes is like
          - Container Image > Deployment > Pod > Service
    - Container Image is the actual image of your app that you want to run, maybe it has multiple of those.
    - Deployment is like defining what and how many (other things too) to run.
    - Pod is like the actual unit of containers; in itself, it has no control, it just runs whatever was given to it.
    - Service is like the layer that exposes it to the world, maybe the network, the other containers, which are like a configurable exposure of the network.
- [I am disappointed in AI discourse](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-am-disappointed-in-the-ai-discourse/?ref=dailydev)
    - Wow, at least someone feels like me. This was so relatable to read on a Sunday afternoon.
    - This feels relatable to feel like how can people draw conclusions and biases when the technology is evolving everyday.
    - People are either fully bullish on AI, i.e. by 2026, no developers needed, to some saying AI is still crap. Both of them don’t know what AI is capable yet. It is not that bad, compared to a year ago, it’s really good at generating almost accurate code, but not quite the touch that it can be untouched without a developer glancing and ficing it.
- [The Software Engineering Identity Crisis](https://annievella.com/posts/the-software-engineering-identity-crisis/)
    - The quote that sums this well is this:
      > Perhaps the most valuable skill in this new landscape isn’t prompt engineering or systems architecture, but **adaptability** - the willingness to evolve, to learn new skills, and to find your unique place in a rapidly changing field.
    - Adoption is a skill that you can hone and be an engineer of the AI revolution
    - The first part that hits me the most is the loss of joy. I talked about it in the previous weeks. I don’t want to repeat that rambling, but yes, that somewhat feels a bit uncomfortable to digest.
    - An excellent post in navigating this AI landscape while maintaining the core feelings of a developer and where it breaks.
- [Programming with Agents: Sketch.dev](https://sketch.dev/blog/programming-with-agents)
    - Great post on agents, good and expected take on agent definition
    - David also narrates the need for agents and why they are suddenly in the hype. The function calling thing just blew the AI hype and at that time, the LLMs were not ready or trained for it. But in 2025, those LLMs are optimised for it, making it a great ecosystem to work towards.
    - This actually raises questions: Do you really need the craft? The IDE? If the agent can do it for you at the speed of a prompt? Yes, LLMs are not gods, they need assistance, and when they go berserk, its on the developer to hone on his tools and hack it out of the mess.
- [The Gentle Singularity: Sam Altman’s Blog](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity)
    - The other stuff is just sci-fi future prediction. I don’t think that is true, but his vision is a bit daunting if that is slightly true.
    - He also mentions how many watts are consumed per GPT call, which is hilariously alarming.
- [Anyone can cook: How 37 Signals hired a junior developer](https://world.hey.com/jorge/anyone-can-cook-c6346f84)
    - Intrinsic motivation is greater than an educational degree; this is true for any professional. Because the degree won’t sustain you longer, if there is a fire within, that will carry on.
- [AI IDEs Free Tier War](https://ainativedev.io/news/ide-free-tier-war-windsurf)
    - Windsurf is surprisingly cheap, but they don’t have access to models like Claude 4 and others.
    - GPT 4.1 is good and all, but that’s a little supbar with the standard of Claude
    - I don’t know if that’s just me or I feel confident in copy-pasting a file from claude than from GPT
