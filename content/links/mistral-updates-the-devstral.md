# Mistral updates the Devstral

**Link:** https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2507

## Context

[XAI releases Grok 4](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/grok-4-0709): The model is the smartest model to date, and also the most expensive. Interesting quirk is that, if you ask for its opinions, it dials up Elon Musk’s Tweets to find his opinion. Wired quirk but maybe *unintentional*
- [Cursor Pricing drama](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/): Cursor just updated / clarified their pricing for the individual plan and being costing a bit high for unlimited usage.
- [Perplexity launches Comet browser](https://comet.perplexity.ai/): Now AI is getting into everything. I am not sure when this will end. People are just too eager to cram AI in the silliest of things.

As expected, there was a model release this week, if you have been following the trend, we are nearly getting a new model every two weeks. And for the past two weeks, there was no major model drop and this was anticipated. Next week Open AI might be cooking something.

That’s it from the week 50, we are close on the one year anniversary of this newsletter. Wow! a whole year has been gone in writing these newsletters, didn’t expect it to be that quick.
