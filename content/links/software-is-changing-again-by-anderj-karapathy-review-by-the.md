## Context

- [“Software is changing again by Anderj Karapathy” Review by the Primeagen](https://youtu.be/vDWaKVmqznQ?si=fiu9XxFxCBN8n92K)
    - Analogies man, they are everywhere.
    - Andrej drew a few analogies like OS and Electricity with AI and LLMs, which makes sense but Primeagen rightly said that he could come up with any thing and compare it with anything if he has too, but understanding deeper just breaks the analogies, which was the reason I was writing the before mentioned post, all of this clicked to me.
