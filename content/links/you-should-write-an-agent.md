# You should write an agent

**Link:** https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/

## Context

A good one. You need to experience the thing in order to have an opinion. That’s quite obvious. But people coming on conclusions about AI and LLMs don’t quite think that way. They do one thing and generalize their opinion. Generalization of experiences is not good. I have used Cursor, cursor-agent cli, gemini cli, and amp cli free version. I can have opinions about them. But I cannot about Claude Code, Codex, and the bazillions of those CLI agentic models.
