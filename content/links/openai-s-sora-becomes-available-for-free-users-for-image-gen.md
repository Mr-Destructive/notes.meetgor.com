## Context

[Open AI buys Windsurf for $3 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/openai-reaches-agreement-to-buy-startup-windsurf-for-3-billion): I watched an video of Thoe comparing the usage of these AI IDEs/editors, and Windsurf seems to be low at 4% adoption compared to almost 40% of VS Code and 30% of Other IDEs, and around 20-30% of Cursor usage. Which makes people think, why windsurf? Maybe that is a production-ready enterprise-grade IDE? I have used it and had no problems using it, but Cursor is good too.
