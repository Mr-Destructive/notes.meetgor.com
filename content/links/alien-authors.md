## Context

Wow, this is just wow. The analogy of writers managing a bunch of written text from AI to create their own story is quite relatable to a developer managing a bunch of parallel agents to generate code and design a feature or come up with a solution. The whole story was really cleverly put and relatable. Though I would argue it’s quite a bad one for making one artist happy. I never want an artist to generate art with AI and tweak and tweak to please someone. Art is something that comes fully from the heart, otherwise, it’s not art. It’s pseudo art, artificial art, forced art.
