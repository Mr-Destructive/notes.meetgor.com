# v18

**Link:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/release-18.html#RELEASE-18-UTILITY

## Context

- SQL Logs
    - Learned to use Foreign keys and create
          - One to One relations
          - One to Many relations
          - Many to Many relations
          - Self referencing relations
    - In SQLite, foreign key constraint is not enabled by default, you need to explicitly set it as `PRAGMA foreign_key=on`. SQLite is very flexible, though it sometimes feels like a double-edged sword, so flexible by default, strict only when said, kind of good, but one can easily shot on the foot.
    - I tweeted about it [here](https://x.com/MeetGor21/status/1967818642768470447). Generated columns are quite new. This was added in:
          - SQLite [3.31](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_31_0.html) (in Jan 2020)
          - PostgreSQL [v18](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/release-18.html#RELEASE-18-UTILITY) (in Sep 2025)
          - MySQL [v5.7](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-nutshell.html) (in Oct 2015)
