## Context

Week #36

Was quite a work-holic week, did a lot of things this week. Debugging, prompting, scripting, flying through a random codebase and number crunching. I felt good, I am genuinely curious about Agents now and want to experiment a lot this weekend. Will have a video or two about it.
