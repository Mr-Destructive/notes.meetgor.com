# Golang Web: PATCH Method

## Context

[Golang Web: PATCH Method](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-web-patch-method/) (37th post in 100 days of Golang Series) I wrote a 3k-word article, it was fun, and it was so rewarding. I learned a lot about different types of PATCH requests, the MERGE PATCH Request, the JSON PATCH Request, and the normal PATCH which is kind of misplaced everywhere. - Merge PATCH is quite the essence of the PATCH Request, we only send the field / updated field in the request and we expect the server will update those fields only. - JSON PATCH is the more complicated or I should say more fine tuned request. If the API or the resources are JSON based, this type of PATCH Reuqest is quite suitable and recommended.
