## Context

**The New Era of Writing Code**: This is so relatable, I was just using some AI to wire up some functions and making it easier at certain task, but worse at the other, I won’t be surprised to see something like a AI Stack in the upcoming months, Like a set of Models, Providers, templates and prompt cheat sheet for developers and other tasks.
