## Context

[From words to worlds with spatial intelligence](https://drfeifei.substack.com/p/from-words-to-worlds-spatial-intelligence)- This a refreshing read, a positive take on the LLM thing. Its true, the words might have limitations, we don’t even know what true VLLMs are capable of, they can’t actually recognize the physical space, and what interpretations can they perform on it.
