# From words to worlds with spatial intelligence

## Context

This a refreshing read, a positive take on the LLM thing. Its true, the words might have limitations, we don’t even know what true VLLMs are capable of, they can’t actually recognize the physical space, and what interpretations can they perform on it. The one thing that stuck with me was the use of LLM in education or learning. It is ranked or stated at the very end, indicating that LLMs are going to be least used to reform how we learn. If that is true, then I can take a relief. If they can’t change the way we learn things, I am a happy and satisfied person. It helps me use my brain rather than I handing over my neurons to it.
