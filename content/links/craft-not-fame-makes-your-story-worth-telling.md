## Context

This is not a technical read, but worth mentioning here. If you’re concerned that your story is too boring, put some effort into making it matter Everybody has a story to tell. You just need to pick the right ones, and to give it some meaning So true and well said here. If you really want to tell a story, you will write one, else, you will find excuses or make a horrendous mess of AI and average slop
