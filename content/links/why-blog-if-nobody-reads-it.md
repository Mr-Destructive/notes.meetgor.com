## Context

[Why Blog if nobody reads it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992159#:~:text=Why%20blog%20if%20nobody%20reads,Hacker%20News&text=Writing%20on%20a%20blog%20is,ve%20written%20in%20the%20past.)? This is a good post, why write articles when no one reads them. According to spirituality or philosophically, do work without caring for the result. But is writing articles is work? or hobby? Either of them, just do it because you have or need to or just so. Really there is no answer, will this universe be affected if you write or not write that post? Probably not, will it impact you, probably yes in a good way, will drain some time but I can guarantee after 3 years of blogging, you will have a better understanding (at least something) from what you had before writing. Just write it.
