I forgot what celery was doing internally, I had used it, and built background workers while I was an intern @ [Arka 360 (The Solar Labs](https://arka360.com/in)). I learned a ton of celery and Django, but it was 2 years back, forgot a few things, and after watching this it clicked everything and now makes sense.Double click to interact with video ## Learnt
