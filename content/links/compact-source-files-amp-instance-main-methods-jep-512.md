**Link:** https://openjdk.org/jeps/512

## Context

- Java 25 Released
    - How can one miss this update?
    - [Compact source files & instance main methods (JEP 512)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/512)
    - Finally the boilerplate is reduced in Java, one less thing to hate Java for. I never hated it for that, but never mind.
