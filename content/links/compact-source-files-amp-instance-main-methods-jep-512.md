**Link:** https://openjdk.org/jeps/512

## Context

Finally the boilerplate is reduced in Java, one less thing to hate Java for. I never hated it for that, but never mind.
- OpenAI releases Codex, model, CLI, and cloud agent, or everything
    - Hhh! How many products Open AI has with Codex? I know the name is nice, but move on with it and be creative, the o- series was less confusing then this mess.
