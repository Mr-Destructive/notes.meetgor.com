    Fascinating. A sourcegraph AI Agent is around the corner. Wow this could be the first one to actually replicate the editing experience. We know LLMs can’t really drive the code, so let them do the chore work while we think. That is the approach Sourcegraph will be taking, they are not completely saying LLMs are bad, they are infact bullish on LLMs, claude can do almost anything provided the tools, so LLMs with tools and context is a big brain move.
