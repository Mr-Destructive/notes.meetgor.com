# Why GenAI Infrastructure feels backward

## Context

I agree to this, this post can’t read this entire thing, but can understand the point of view
    - Python and Javascript seems to be taking the forefront in the infrastructure side of things. All AI-Labs first launch SDKs and Packages for these two ecosystems, but never the others which are suited for them like Go or Rust.
    - It’s time to change and make a difference in this revolution.
