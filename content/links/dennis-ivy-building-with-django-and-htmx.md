## Context

- [Dennis Ivy: Building with Django and HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgegMr8ImKo&t=2607s)  
  I have not touched Django and HTMX as well for quite some months (maybe a year). I need to get back and create some quick projects for the community. I want to keep the guides and tutorials on Django from my article series more versatile and expansive. Talking about the stream, it was a great stream, loved that Dennis is back, learned a lot of stuff with htmx. A lot to learn when done yourself.
