## Context

- [Gemini 2.5 better model for coding tasks](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-pro-io-improved-coding-performance): Gemini is really taking the lead here. Anthropic might lose the bet on the code quality vs cost race here if they don’t launch a great model in a couple of months (We all know they will)
