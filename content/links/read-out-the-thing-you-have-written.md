# Read out the thing you have written

**Link:** https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SayYourWriting.html

## Context

This is like a thought or tip from Martin Fowler
    - He suggests to read out (at least lip movement) the thing we have written. I really like it and have not noticed it yet, but yes that is true.
    - We get a different perspective and feel for the draft that we have written. Its almost like reviewing your code locally vs on GitHub. You get something while reading out that you don’t just reading in mind.
