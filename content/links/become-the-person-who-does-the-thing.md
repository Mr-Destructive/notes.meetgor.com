## Context

[https://www.fredrivett.com/2025/09/10/becoming-the-person-who-does-the-thing/](https://www.fredrivett.com/2025/09/10/becoming-the-person-who-does-the-thing/) Yes, the world right now feels like everything is pushing me in a direction that I wanted, in my favor. For real! Journalling, job searching, embracing boredom, learning and locking in, and the most recent thing since almost a week, building a exercise routine. I also believed physical fitness is not important as mental well being. But I am coming to realize, there is no mental fitness if the body is not fit. At least it should be moving. By working remotely I was sucked into sitting and consuming junk/content. Feeling lethargic and exhausted all the time, last weekend, my brother set me up for an exercise, I felt energetic after that. I have been doing minimum 20 minutes each day since and keeping away from the vicious consumption cycle. Side by side, I am also on a writing streak of 24 on SQL and SQLite on my blog here with sqlog. This all is pushing me to get better and be the person I want to be. This article helps me validate everything I am doing, I don't need validation for the actions I do, but a human is a social animal, he needs resonance and some level of accountability or validation for what I am heading for is the correct place or not.
