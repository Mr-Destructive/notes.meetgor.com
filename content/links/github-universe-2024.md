## Context

* [GitHub Universe 2024](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/universe-2024-previews-releases/): There is baggage to be unloaded here. Definitely a lot of AI, but also a lot of other stuff as well. I guess the AI hype is no more hype, it has become a reality, we need to accept it more I guess. But not blindly.
