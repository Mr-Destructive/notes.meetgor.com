## Context

12. [Do blogs need to be so lonely](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/do-blogs-need-to-be-so-lonely/)
    - Collaborative blogging, I think hashnode tried to do it with community blogs and co-authoring. I like it but I feel that it's quite rare to collaborate on shared interesting topics, a podcast or a video interview might be a better fit to show the communication. Blogs don't really fit that quite well in my opinion, but yes distinct parts of the blog could be collaborated.
