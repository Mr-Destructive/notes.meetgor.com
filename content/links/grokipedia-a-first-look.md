# Grokipedia: A first look

## Context

I really like the post. It was a balanced take on the new hyped LLM site. It looks good, maybe it serves a purpose, but still, that 1% of the search I am doing I want to be 100% sure, not 101% confidently wrong. We don’t know what this will do to the learning and knowledge bowl of humans, but it might have an impact, good or bad. It's a pivotal moment in internet history. We are either full-on AI or superhumans.
