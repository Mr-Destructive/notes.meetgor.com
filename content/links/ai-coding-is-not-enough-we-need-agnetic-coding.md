# AI Coding is not enough we need Agnetic Coding:

## Context

This is wild. I have been sleeping on Claude Code and Warp
        
    * Those are the ones that are truly agentic editors.
        
    * AI Coding (which people are pissed at) versus, Agentic Coding, that is really the difference. Agentic coding opens a wild number of possibilities. This is the second time I am overwhelmed in life in programming. One was with Vim and Linux, there were so many things to learn and experiment with. And this time, it’s LLMs, models, tools, and so many details to learn, so many behaviours to understand. This is fascinating. Just watch this video, I can’t be thankful to this person enough.
