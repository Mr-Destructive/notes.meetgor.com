## Context

[A slow blogging year](https://anarc.at/blog/2025-02-09-one-failed-year/?ref=dailydev): Wow, I also need to do some posts this year, I moved from 41 (2021), 40 (2022), 11 (2023), and 14 (2024). Need to write more, On the initial day, I had too much to express, but as days progressed, the friction reduced but the quality of that increased, first, it was about quantity, the motivation, and then it was consistency about improving.
