# The Software Engineering Identity Crisis

## Context

The quote that sums this well is this:
      > Perhaps the most valuable skill in this new landscape isn’t prompt engineering or systems architecture, but **adaptability** - the willingness to evolve, to learn new skills, and to find your unique place in a rapidly changing field.
    - Adoption is a skill that you can hone and be an engineer of the AI revolution
    - The author thinks that there will be engineering in terms of managing and overlooking Agents or AI Systems. Also a good point mentioned is “The scope of engineering is not shrinking, it’s expanding”. I can see this point coming true in some sense as the level of understanding to drive these AI systems is better suitable to programmers and engineers. Since they already deal with the pain of solving problems. AI is no different.
    - The first part that hits me the most is the loss of joy. I talked about it in the previous weeks. I don’t want to repeat that rambling, but yes, that somewhat feels a bit uncomfortable to digest.
    - An excellent post in navigating this AI landscape while maintaining the core feelings of a developer and where it breaks.
