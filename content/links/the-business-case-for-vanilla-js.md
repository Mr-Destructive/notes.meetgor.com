# The Business case for Vanilla JS

**Link:** https://lewiscampbell.tech/blog/250430.html

## Context

1. Just write plain javascript and shut it up. Why are we really bottling ourselves with the gazillions of frameworks and mental load of understanding each other’s semantics and constraints and styles.
    2. Why is there a need to create abstraction on top of abstractions. I get it, that writing javascript is cubersome each time. But the amount of abstraction and the cost of it adds is wild. We have a separate steps and ecosystem for doing just these, man!
