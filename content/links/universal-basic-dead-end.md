## Context

  We are in the AI revolution right now, just like how we had the computer revolution. People thought, everyone would lose their jobs, but are we out of jobs? In fact, there are more jobs than ever. Right now, yes the market is bad, and the jobs are fewer, but does that mean AI will replace humans? If yes, you are in the wrong world.
