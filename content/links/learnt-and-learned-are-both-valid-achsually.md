## Context

* [**Learnt and Learned are both valid achsually**](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/commonly-confused-words/learned-learnt/)  
    I use the title of this section as `LEARNT` but `LEARNED` is fine as well, and Grammarly makes both incorrect, he wants it to be `Learn` it is done, I have learned it this week, I am not learning it now, so please stop yelling at me about that. Then in [their article](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/commonly-confused-words/learned-learnt/), they say both are valid, what a sweet cohesion!
