# Kimi adds its own CLI AI Coding Agent to the race

**Link:** https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli

## Context

It now has 2 different modes of viewing the IDE, one is where you can see your agents, no code, just a chat interface. I like it. I won’t use it much, but I can see where it can shine, like just spinning up some agents to do some scripting and producing some throwaway code. [Canva launches affinity](https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/all-new-affinity/)- This is huge. I can see myself using it for editing and creating videos If I do any in the future. [Kimi adds its own CLI AI Coding Agent to the race](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli)- This looks like Claude code, Kimi is making it clear that it is competing with Anthropic. [Github Universe 2025](https://githubuniverse.com/)- Copilot and Agent Hub and what not is release. I hope GitHub becomes a better place for software developers. [Amazon lays off 15K workforce](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/28/amazon-to-cut-14000-corporate-jobs/)- A layoff after a outage, seems a little eye opener for them, maybe that was just an excuse for that.

It could be an interesting week, if I do certain things correctly and let myself calm down. Happy Coding :) Leave a comment
