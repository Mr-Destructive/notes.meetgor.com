So, let’s wrap up this week, which has been a bit harsh for me. Locking out on Friday from work at 10, no it was not forced, I was just curious to fix that damn bug. But alas despite all the efforts, the bug was not solved entirely, still the core remains making me feel a little sad but a bit satisfied as the major issue was resolved.

See you next week, Bye

Happy Coding :)
