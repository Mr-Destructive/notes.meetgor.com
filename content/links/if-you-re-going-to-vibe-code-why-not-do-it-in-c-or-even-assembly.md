# If you’re going to vibe code, why not do it in C or even Assembly

**Link:** https://stephenramsay.net/posts/vibe-coding.html

## Context

Yeah! This is a valid point, If you are not caring about the code, why bother with the language. Choose a language which computers can understand the best, x86 or even machine code, 1s and 0s. Stephen says to create a VOPL vibe-oriented-programming-language which suits LLMs. Maybe this is what it will look it, who knows. But the point is strong, if vibe coding is not caring about programming, why bother choosing tech stack and languages, just let it choose whichever it is familiar and good at just like a good’ol developer.
