## Context

So many hot takes and might change my perspective on software engineering
    - Simplify development is important than elegance, eg. Ruby over Python, SQL over ORMs
    - Using editor to chisel out code, and not let AI rip it.
    - Finally someone to speak about the craft of coding, the fun of writing code alone, in the darkness, letting us spare time and let us cook.
    - Engineering managers are meaningless for startups.
