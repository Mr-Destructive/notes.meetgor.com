# It's insulting to read your AI-generated blog post

**Link:** https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/

## Context

I will never ever try to use AI in writing. Becuase I want to think, otherwise what is the purpose of doing anything. If humans just hand off every bit of things to AI what is the moat of humans? What is the advantage of having a big brain. Its like having two queens on the chess board and still not able to checkmate. Skill issues.
