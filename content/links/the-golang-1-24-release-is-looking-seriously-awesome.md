## Context

[The Golang 1.24 release is looking seriously awesome](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/go-124/?ref=dailydev) I don’t think this is a big release, yes there are a few cool little things that are added up in the standard library. But nothing groundbreaking as the 1.23 and 1.21 releases.
