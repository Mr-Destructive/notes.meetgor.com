## Context

Wrote: [Creating and Working with Embedded Replicas of LibSQL Database hosted on Turso in a Golang Project](https://www.meetgor.com/turso-libsql-embedded-replicas-golang/): I already have created a video on this, so just created an outline and wrote the article on my blog. I find this approach good, it helps me solidify the learnings from the knowledge that I gained from making the video and adding more examples and use-cases.
