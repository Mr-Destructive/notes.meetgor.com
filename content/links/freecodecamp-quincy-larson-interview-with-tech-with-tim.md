# FreeCodeCamp (Quincy Larson) interview with Tech with Tim

**Link:** https://youtu.be/mgWOMu2yo_U?si=Aq8jJJ4w2-TgwkDo

## Context

This is a good talk, while growing up as a developer, I watched Tim while learning Python and Django, so he has been a teacher to me in some way or the other, and seeing his raw thoughts behind his life, feels good to listen to.
