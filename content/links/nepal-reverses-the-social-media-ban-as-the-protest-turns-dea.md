## Context

- [Nepal reverses the social media ban as the protest turns deadly](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/nepal-reverses-social-media-ban-as-protests-turn-deadly/): Really a deadly situation in Nepal, I can relate as I have my work colleagues working there. Government is pretty unstable and it might create havoc for such a fragile nation which might add misery to the already poor state.
