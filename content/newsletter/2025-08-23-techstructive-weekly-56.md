Continuing the learning path of SQL, and taking it to a next level with consistent posting of log like posts, reading a ton of hackernews articles, researching about AI generated images metadata, and a lot of python code.</p><p>I will try to take a break this weekend, try to think what I want to see myself in the next 5 years, 3 years, and 1 year. I really want to think what I am and want to be as a person. Thanks to the post that I read this week, also will continue with SQL lessons or even take a course or certification.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/171664576/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“Being born is probably the most difficult thing we ever have to do. If you can survive the ordeal of being born, you can get through anything.”</p><p>—  Michiko Aoyama</p><p><span>“</span><em>What You Are Looking For Is in the Library</em><span>”</span></p></blockquote><p>This is such a great quote. It shows the meaning in birth. If you read the book, you’ll understand it much better. But TLDR is that you are in someone’s womb, you don’t know what is it to breathe, to open eyes, to cry, to feel your body, but still you move out of the womb and you are born. You faced the most non-deterministic thing. Now everything after that will be simple compared to that.</p><p>Similar is the situation of suicide or death feelings, if you are ready to give up and die, you have gone through everything and ready to get over the most dreadful things of life, death. If you had that feeling, you are at a much high tolerant level, everything else feels small and you could handle it, just hang in there, something beautiful might be coming your way.</p><p>Life is about extremes!</p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Wrote<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§wrote"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/171664576/wrote" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><p>Anyways, lets see what I took under the creation section for the week.

So much valuable advice for juniors and people who are all over the place and feeling overwhelmed or burned out.</p></li><li><p>What do you want to be in like 5 years, 3 years, 1 year? That hit me like a truck. I never think about the future, but still there needs to be specific I enjoy and would want to keep enjoying and learning. I know that's a too generic AI like answer but that is where the real friction will arise and I think we will emerge out of it with a fresh perspective. After having asked a lot of questions and having a better idea about our likes and dislikes, thinking without any pressure just gives us the opportunity to truly see beneath us.</p></li><li><p>I don't think the steps mentioned there are necessary, like I know this might be done for relaxing the user (taking leave in the middle of a week, going a entire day at the waffle-house or cafe). But the process is to the point.</p></li><li><p>Listing down the goals and what I want to be like a tree like structure, no cycles. Breaking down one goal from 5 year to 3, then 1 and then month and then weeks. That makes it really clear and forces us to double down on our true "calling" or the muse if you think in that way.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://sanitarium.se/blog/2025/08/21/what-makes-a-good-software-engineer" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">What makes a good software engineer</a></p><ul><li><p>Curiosity to build the right thing, and being honest about it.</p></li><li><p>Trust is super valuable, I have experienced it working remotely at my 1+ year stay at my current company.</p></li><li><p>I often just do it for doing it, then I hit it with I need to know why this needs to be done and done correctly. Then things take shape, curiosity out performs every other emotion.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.habets.se/2025/07/Go-is-still-not-good.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Go is still not good</a></p><ul><li><p>I can agree to only one points here especially the standard library swallowing exceptions part. That sometimes is little on the border of Go's philosophy vs the actual issue. Just read the f-ing manual would be the argument, but it kind of becomes too verbose and critical if mishandled.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://hturan.com/writing/exploring-exif" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Exploring EXIF</a></p><ul><li><p>A great post, diving into a specific tool for a lot of things.</p></li><li><p>I think the media metadata is messed up, the software is not consistently adhering to the standards. Look at the blog post and the Apple photos have a lot more metadata then Google or any other photo taking software.</p></li><li><p>I have to say the different of fields are in orders of magnitude more than the rest. How much additional info they cram into a single photo is bewildering.</p></li><li><p>I really liked the post, it had dumping of data into sqlite database and writing queries to get certain things, how cute and interesting that idea is. My brain is running in all directions at this now.</p></li><li><p>LLMs to write queries to get photos from albums with natural language and metadata without actually processing the image, is one I can hit straight off my head.</p></li><li><p>I confirmed that it Apple who is pouring love into those photos. It probably has to do a lot of things in the background to get the metadata. Such a irony of tech today. Lagging behind the trend but way ahead of everyone in the core.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://bowendwelle.substack.com/p/ai-writing-addictive" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">How AI writing supercharged an addictive pattern</a></p><ul><li><p>We'll have been there and done that. The initial WOW! to the glorious vibe crap that comes after 12 hours of prumpting.</p></li><li><p>I know there is a lot of value in AI, I am not a AI doomer, but the things people are assuming like 10x dev, replacing a junior dev, an intern, I don't buy that both emotionally and mentally. It just hurts the morale of humans to say that. If that is the case, then just flip the lever and let the software world be in chaos.</p></li><li><p>AI assisted coding can be a bit addictive I agree, that's why if there is some joy in my side project, I do start it myself and then ask AI bits and pieces to figure it out, I don't let it rip my project, I am still an advocate of chat based AI-assisted development. That friction of copy-pasta I can tolerate but not the shit-shoving of vibe coded mess.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@vishnugoswami6000/5-docker-networking-basics-every-beginner-should-actually-understand-7a558a6c5c0a" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">5 Docker networking concepts that everyone should know</a></p><ul><li><p>This was a fantastic walk-through of one of the un-explained parts of docker. Surely there are exhaustive lists of commands to perform things in the docker networking, but very few dive into the why part. This article specifically did that and all the commands made sense.</p></li><li><p>The bridge is the safe default, setting custom host is for advanced usage, avoid if possible, only dive if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Custom networks makes communication clear between containers</p><p>user names, not IPs.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://graic.net/p/left-to-right-programming" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Left to Right Programming</a></p><ul><li><p>If python looks odd, how about SQL?

Too much bearish on AI now. Suddenly people realise they need to put breaks to the hype and focus on improving the craft before cracks start forming into dents and large holes.</p><blockquote><p><span>Making all your engineers feel constantly anxious about their performance is </span><em>bad for your company</em><span>. It will make your engineers not want to work for you. This is a recipe for short term thinking that will encourage engineers to max out bad metrics, like lines of code.

Waylon Walker's Markata (its a python plugin based ssg, so easy to extend and setup) and my static site generator (I am calling it burrow, inspired as a home for golang gophers).
