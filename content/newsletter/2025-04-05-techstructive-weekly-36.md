## Week #36

Was quite a work-holic week, did a lot of things this week. Debugging, prompting, scripting, flying through a random codebase and number crunching. I felt good, I am genuinely curious about Agents now and want to experiment a lot this weekend. Will have a video or two about it.

Finally it was a week, a little slow down after a 2 back to back weeks of AI launching and breaking the expectations. The image generation, gemma models, gemini 2.5 and mistral OCR, and what not have been released in the last stretch of first quarter of 2025. Phew! it was a heck of a quarter, that went in a jiffy.

Believe me, talent and hard work is deadly combo. You don’t want to be competing with that kind of group of people, you might easily slip out, if you are just hard working or just talent won’t be enough, there needs to be a fire, a purpose, a curiosity burning that will lift even the one without feet and help fly without wings.
