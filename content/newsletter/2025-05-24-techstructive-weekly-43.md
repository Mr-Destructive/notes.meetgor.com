This was expected, nothing new. New week, new models, every day feels closer to losing the developer job. But everytime, AI sucks and human grug brain works.</p><p>This week, I took a step back and tried to ease myself out from this AI slop. Want to really plan the things out and start the grind again. Need to re-align my core values and get back to the consistent and curious flaming torch in guiding myself in the AI abyss.</p><p>LLMs and AI Labs are out of control, they are releasing new models left and right.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Number of LLM models released this week: 5<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§number-of-llm-models-released-this-week-5"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/164244470/number-of-llm-models-released-this-week-5" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><ul><li><p>Gemini 2.5 Flash Pro (improved)</p></li><li><p>Gemma 3n</p></li><li><p>Devstral</p></li><li><p>Vercel’s v0-1.0-md model</p></li><li><p>Claude 4 family (Sonnet and Opus)</p></li></ul><p>This is a new section.

For my understanding, as well as creating a resource for this AI hype, to get my hands dirty.</p><p>Some personal news, I migrated my blog from markata to my own SSG from scratch, named Burrow. Bold move! I don’t care, no one’s reading my post, so it doesn’t matter, I kept the links intact.

If not, I am going to create one specifically for LLM and AI stuff, because this thing is getting out of hand. We are seeing models drop almost every 2 days. This is crazy stuff. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, xAI, Alibaba, Cohere, in loops over months and weeks with new models. The never-ending cycle. Let’s see if we can predict what model will be next.</p><p>Ok, this week we say 5 LLM models are getting released, and those are not any normal models, those are quite a significant push in the state of the art for what LLMs can do.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Anthropic with Claude 4 family (Sonnet and Opus)</a></p><ul><li><p>Quite solid in coding task, I just tried giving it a golang file and it corrected all the errors and weird quirks it had.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/devstral" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Mistral with Devstral</a></p><ul><li><p>This is a 14 GB, 23 Billion Parameter model for coding task</p></li><li><p>Not sure about performance but it requires 32 GB Ram to run, so I am out of uck on that. </p></li><li><p>Waiting for a slight lightweight model.
