That’s what I can say. I continued writing. I experimented with quite a lot of things. VLLMs, new models, new approaches, tactics, and read a lot of articles as usual.</p><p>As I was in the GCP Cloud Log Explorer TUI in the bubbletea golang app, I vibe-coded it, I wanted to feel it. No, I am not using that to publish on GitHub. I would make one from bare hands, what to put in the model, on the screen, when to update what, which keybindings to add where, I will think about each of them and code from scratch. My goal is to learn and build, not just build.</p><p>I wrote for the whole week, 21 days in the streak, and feeling good and motivated to complete the month on a high note, the project isn’t complete, but it put it on the right stage for me to complete it.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/179561688/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><strong>“You can always edit a bad page. You can’t edit a blank page.”</strong><br/><span>— </span><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568141-you-can-always-edit-a-bad-page-you-can-t-edit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jodi Picoul</a></em></p></blockquote><p>I’ll go with this one. I have written for the past 20 days, and I can surely say I am a bad first drafter. I have no story, just an idea of a scene or a plot for an entire story. I am lost in the start. I still put pen to paper, wrote ~1000 words daily, and here I have some things to move the story, from point A to B.</p><p>Another quote might be</p><blockquote><p>“As you start to walk the way appears”</p><p><span>— </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/811906-as-you-start-to-walk-on-the-way-the-way" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Rumi</a></p></blockquote><p>I had one idea, but the start was blank. I still wrote some garbage. It was enough to help me break the barrier and helped in thinking out. After writing so much shit, not slop, I have a good understanding of what works and what the issues are. As the first quote goes, you can’t edit an empty page. There is no story to edit, there are no flaws to fix, no plotholes to patch, what is that for? You have to fail, understand the missing points, connect the dots, and move forward.</p><p></p><blockquote></blockquote><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/179561688/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://secondthoughts.ai/p/a-project-is-not-a-bundle-of-tasks" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A project is not a bundle ot tasks</a></p><ul><li><p>This is one of the best and practically grounded takes on the progress on AI. If it can’t make a decision that lasts longer, it might collapse eventually. AI Coding has improved over the last year for sure, but is it there? Not really. A developer still has to understand the logic, think about the AI answers, there has to be a human intuition and judgement to make its way to a sustainable solution.</p></li><li><p>As per the growth, developers might be overgrown by 2030, is that really that quick? Maybe the plateau is almost here. It can code, sure, but it doesn’t create anything. It can create something like they are created by humans, not something out of the blue.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://behan.substack.com/p/alien-authors" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Alien Authors</a></p><ul><li><p>Wow, this is just wow. The analogy of writers managing a bunch of written text from AI to create their own story is quite relatable to a developer managing a bunch of parallel agents to generate code and design a feature or come up with a solution.</p></li><li><p>The whole story was really cleverly put and relatable. Though I would argue it’s quite a bad one for making one artist happy. I never want an artist to generate art with AI and tweak and tweak to please someone. Art is something that comes fully from the heart, otherwise, it’s not art. It’s pseudo art, artificial art, forced art.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://davegriffith.substack.com/p/why-software-development-fell-to" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Why Software Development fell to AI first</a></p><ul><li><p>It makes sense now,</p><ul><li><p>It is instantly verifiable&gt; if you can run it, it has some potential</p></li><li><p>The medium is the message &gt; Text in &gt; text out</p></li><li><p>There is verification, and it can check itself &gt; if there are tests, it can run, it can itself verify if the generated code works or not, and tweak accordingly</p></li></ul></li><li><p>These are compelling enough reasons to understand that software is quite suited for AI to bite its jaws from.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The 18th November 2025 Cloudflare Outage Report</a></p><ul><li><p>Ok, that was quite a big outage.

It got a few eyes on the engineering debt.</p></li><li><p>I wonder if Cloudflare was really required in their tech stack who were affected in this outage. Really?
