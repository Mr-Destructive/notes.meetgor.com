I didn’t knew I would say that at the start of the week. But hell yes, a promotion, finally. A hope at the end of the tunnel. Hard work pays off in the end. I kept believing and finally able to bring smile on my loved ones.</p><p>I quoted last week about home, a family, is not something that is by blood, rather it is the group of people who strive for each others success, for uplifting each other, when one falls down the other roots for him or her, when its harsh time, everyone steps back and stays together. And I was able to experience just that. The true value and meaning of a family and life.</p><p>Not just my family. I was able to believe that the people I work with are also a family, after a long time, I was able to feel that I belong somewhere else too, I was appreciated. My work was worthwhile, the fruit of efforts are sweet, especially when you don’t expect it.</p><p>I am quite happy and in a good mood. I am not able to quit this endless loop of promising a youtube livestream but keep on failing week-after-week. This week, let’s get it right.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/175204515/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><strong>“</strong><span>You weren’t rejected. You were merely redirected</span><strong>”</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>— </span><strong>Elaine Welteroth</strong></p></blockquote><p>Yes, I’ll go with this  for the week. I did everything for 2 years. Same problem, same person. But things change, conditions change, you fight, you are put down, you try to get around it, but rejected, the journey seems over until suddenly you are automatically redirected to where you should have been. You get your validations and your result, you feel good, you move on. Simple, don’t remain stuck, don’t ask why? answer the questions what and how. You are in the situation, you have a problem to face, you can’t question nature, why it was me who was given this problem, that is not in your hand, simply answer what and how do I overcome. That puts you in way better position than grieving over the problem.  </p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Created<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§created"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/175204515/created" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><p>Have stopped the SQLog for a while this week, was busy with other work and plus it was a festive season, so some festivities and longing for a deep mind reset.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-create-table-from-select/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLog: Create Table with SELECT</a></p><ul><li><p>I found it interesting to populate dummy data from existing values.</p></li><li><p>The select statement is so plugable, it just gets into everything.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/175204515/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/academic-information/departments-programs/computer-science/beauty-programming" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The beauty of Programming</a></p><ul><li><p>I love this post, it propagates the love of programming really well.</p></li><li><p>It shows why someone is so driven and addicted in a good way to programming, it feels like he can create anything.
