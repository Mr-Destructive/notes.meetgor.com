## Week #37

A bit of a hectic week. For the past quarter, the weeks have been quite rough, and this is continuing this month too. Need to really breathe air, and take my mind off for a while. But something hurts to quit and take a rest. Bad habits are really hard to break, like not creating a video is becoming my bad habit, really deciding to take action and actual action is the biggest difference.

But somehow we are trapped in the fear of taking action and people still judge us because we spent time and failed, instead someone tried too little effort, still managed to get over the hurdle, or someone worked too hard to get it done. And I lie in the middle, torn between duty and burnout.

Anyway, it’sbeen a bit frustrating week so far, just need to divert my mind to other places and get back on track for video creation and learning up the hill.

### Quote of the week

> “The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity."

Curiosity is the fire, that can kindle life’s biggest paths. I have started reading tiny experiments books, so far it seems that just having no clarity in life, but having curiosity and figuring out on the way is the way of life. For me, some things were luxury at one time, but suddenly in a moment they've become the only option to get out of the puddle I am in. Life is a bit drastic, curiosity is the fire that will keep one alive in the darkest of times.
