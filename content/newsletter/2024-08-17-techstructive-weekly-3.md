## Techstructive Weekly #3

 The week was really tiring for me for some reasons, was not able to work on the side projects. I actually spent some time with my family and cousin who came over the weeks for festivals. However, on the work side of things, I was able to learn a few things about NGINX, pdf parsing and product specific features.

The upcoming week(end) will be actually fun, as I finally have some free time to write some blogs, hopefully will be able to have some things to showcase and share next week about the things I explored or failed at those things.

Thanks for reading Techstructive Weekly! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

## Quote of the week

> "The secret to satisfaction is to find meaning in the journey, not just the destination."

Satisfaction is important in life, you need to understand the difference between your needs and wants. You absolutely have to give your best to satisfy your needs, but don't go too hard on your wants, understand your intentions and the feelings of others as well. Don't get too greedy on reaching the top, its should be about the process, about the art, about the journey, embrace it and focus on that instead.
