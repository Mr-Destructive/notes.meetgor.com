Had to work almost 12 hours at stretch to get something in production. Not the best of times to be working at. Especially when life puts you in wired position, not just in work but in mental situation, you have to believe in yourself and amidst that every other bit of things happen.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Random Thought<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§random-thought"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/168649998/random-thought" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p>I was working away some bugs and fixing issues which was created for some other purpose at the time of initial prototype. But as the time evolved, it changed and deviated from the initial purpose, so fixed the current problem at hand. But people then point out your decisions. I felt grieved, lost, and most importantly wrong. But then things clarify, working all the possibilities of blunder out. Only problem was the decision made by the person in front of me when I asked the question in the past. But it was my fault in the end today. Not blaming anyone, just letting my thoughts out that people are too quick to judge and blame you when things go wrong rather than clarifying what they discussed first. World is cruel for the symphatic, for the humble, for the kind. It’s just is life. Can’t do much. But will you with one inspiration if you are lashed out at and the tides are against you.</p><blockquote><p>Crying is never a sign of your grief, its a sign that you are alive right from your birth.</p></blockquote><p>Is it okay to cry? Probably yes, but don’t feel guilt and shame in crying out, cry alone but wipe out the tears and move on. At the end its only you who have to wipe your own tears, there are people who are around you who care, but crying in front of them might make them sad that’s what you would think. I too think that and cry alone. The journey is lonely, there are people that will help you, guide you, love you but in the end you need to put your foot ahead and walk yourself.</p><p></p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/168649998/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“The oak fought the wind and was broken, the willow bent when it must and survived.”</p><p><span>— </span><strong><span>Robert Jordan, </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/588034" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Fires of Heaven</a></strong></p></blockquote><p>Such a great quote to describe my situation right now. I am just bowing down, accepting the flaws but not the things that were not mine. Just letting go of things, and let life show its wrath or the good behind the bad its happening. Because I can confidently say, every storm ends with a new beginning and there are definitely some things that flourish after the storm but some do get weathered out due to resistance.</p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/168649998/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/13/how-i-do-it" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">How I do it - Daniel Stenberg(Creator and Maintainer of cURL)</a></p><ol><li><p>Such an honest and encouraging post.
