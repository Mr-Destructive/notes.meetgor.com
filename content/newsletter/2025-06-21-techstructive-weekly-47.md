## Week #47

It was a exciting and exhaustive week, in a good way. I was able to almost complete a working AI Chatbot Application, start writing routine for an hour, get inspiration for more project ideas, and a lot of learning in tid-bits around LLMs.

This can’t be more exciting. A week or two before I was drenched in anxiety and negativity around LLMs as replacement for developers, but that’s far from reality and considering them as tools sounds so fun. I feel excited so much so that I feel I have no time to squeeze the energy.

This weekend I was not able to livestream and record any videos due to network issues and also I had a bit of cold. This week hopefully will be doing 2 3-hour live streams on creating projects.

- Mozilla Firefox’s Pocket clone
- LiteLLM Implementation in Golang

Not both of them, either of them will be working this weekend.

I haven’t created any videos, haven’t planned any video as of yet, but have a lot of ideas for writing. I think I will be creating a timer based blog writing, I have to force myself to write a blog. I have lost too many months writing a blog, can’t lose them anymore.

### Quote of the week

> “AI is thinking faster, so we need to think slow”

> — I can’t find who quoted this, but I read it somewhere

This is such a great quote, whoever quoted it, awesome job. AI is producing slop and hit sometimes, it might not be correct every time, since perfection is the enemy of progress. So is math, thinking a problem for LLMs currently, they think a lot, hard, too hard at times, and spiral into overthinking just like humans, but meaningless and not required from machines.

We humans are so funny, we expect LLMs to work perfectly but have trained on the dataset that is imperfect.

We need to sift through the LLMs response, which could be slop or a gem, which ever it is, we need to think a bit slow than what it gave. Reflection is key in the case of AI-assisted anything.
