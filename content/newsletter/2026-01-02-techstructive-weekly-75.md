This is a wired post. I let myself back, reflected more. I know it was a fast paced year for software development. People are here to prove it. I just laid it out straight that its never been valuable to be a human, a distinct, natural and earnest human.</p><p>I must say I completed a non-technical goal of 2025, I have my novel’s first draft in my hands(in my google drive). Its very rough, I want to revise it, I want to remove the fluff, but it is there in its entirety. 33 Chapters, 85K words. 45 days of writing span across 6 months, I did it. I am pumped to revise and write the next novel. The hunger to write has never been higher for me.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/183248540/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“Grit is never bad, grit with wrong intent, for wrong purpose is definitely bad”</p></blockquote><p>I had a grit to write a story, I will write it. It was a grit, not a goal. I had goals for it for the past 4 years, yet when I made it a grit, here it is, I am on top of it. If a grit was something to think bad of someone, or look down on someone with grudge, it is a bad thing. A wrong grit is something born out of desires, rage, frustration, anger or even jealously, None of it could be bad per see. But if the intention of those desires, rage, jealously is for ill of someone then it could be bad, not if it is born to uplift yourself from the ground, after having thumped by life.</p><p>Sometimes, grit is something life give us, throws at you, you need to learn to handle it. It can’t be thought, it needs to experienced. You have to fail, you have to struggle. But here for me, the struggle, the resistance to write finally bent its knee against my grit (not boasting, nor arrogant). Just fierce grit born out of the desire to be a better person, to give back to a human, to say a kind thank you.</p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Wrote<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§wrote"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/183248540/wrote" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/posts/2025-review/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">2025 Year Review</a></p><ul><li><p>Feels good to write this posts.

I alway 100% of the times use the cli. NO aliases, no agents, just CLI commands. git add, commit -m, push, pull, merge, rebase whatever.

This went wild, I thought managing memory was like shooting yourselves on the foot, but not for DBs.</p></li><li><p>So we load the database file, from the disk into memory not as full, but chunks called frames, where each page is contained in the buffer pool. Interesting, this is done in the actual ram or the memory not full at once.</p></li><li><p>So this makes it the different algorithms to decide which frames/pages to keep and evict (remove)</p></li><li><p>There is a difference in lock and latches, a lock is something that protect the database logical content from other transactions i.e. the data to write or avoid corrupted reading</p></li><li><p>However a latch is something that helps in preventing the database internals from other operations, its only for an operation not a query. Its like a mutex.</p></li><li><p>We can’t rely on OS, as OS doesn’t know what are we querying.</p></li><li><p>There are like half a dozen implementation of replacement caches like LRU, Clock, LFU, LRU-K, ARC, etc.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcfISXg--R0" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">How I parsed billions of rows for every user in 2 seconds</a></p><ol><li><p>Wow!
