We are in a different year. 2082 Vikram Samvat, If you are into that. Felt a bit sad, a bit happy. Not sure what the next year might have in offer. Hopefully it would be for the good.</p><p>Compared to last tear, I find myself happier, but lost at the same time. I have found a cure to my writing slump atlast and trying to wrestle a writing routine. It looks a bit promising, 2 months to end 2025, still a comeback on the edge. This year was wild, I had severe anxiety and it kept throwing AI LLM Models every day, all day. Each day felt like waking up from existential crisis, but here I am writing it, the sixty fifth edition. More to come.</p><p>This week as expected was Diwali. A celebration of lighting up lifes, not just diyas and lamps. In the hope of finding a book revolving and giving a vine of Diwali, I am projected towards writing one myself, because it doesn’t exist. Mumbai, middle class, childhood nostalgia, mid semester vacation, crackers, New year wishes, cleaning of home and shops, lighting up the atmosphere, no book covers those. I am excited to be write that book, but not now, I will focus kn finishing the project at hand. Finishing is a skill I lack quite a lot, I want to start my writing career on a good note. So, expect a complete novel by the end of the year. Atleast the first draft.</p><p>Back to tech, I vibed a lot, cursor agent is my new thing at work. I am mostly delegating the heavy lifting from it, so that I can do the actual stuff. I also started using amp code which is free now, on my phone, just a way to explore new repositories or just implement a random side project in middle of day, its pretty cool, its UI is mobile friendly which surprised me. Really looking forward to writing about the experience and the feeling of working with ai code assistant in the terminal.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/177016573/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“To understand is to stand under which is to look up to which is a good way to understand”</p><p>— Corita Kent</p></blockquote><p>Understand, the key thing in todays  AI world is so important. You have to have a good depth, a keen sense of ants eye view, not birds eye view, you literally have to dig things up. AI is there to do the general, surface level digging, anyone can do that, but that doesn't build competence and trust. Understanding does, it could be a concept, a document, codebase, tools, blog anything, someone is expecting it from you, don’t be the same slop as LLM, don’t listen to Richard Button in this case,try to distinguish your efforts from others.</p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/177016573/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://russmiles.substack.com/p/you-cannot-outsource-understanding" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">You cannot outsource understanding</a></p><ol><li><p>So true, this is relief bringer post.

Why?

The depth, the pain of uncomfortable is lost.

Some of the points I found out to be contrasting. The start was promising but he started to shade his own points I believe. The math solving problems, which makes sense, but then evolution of human thinking, the built in parameters.</p></li><li><p>The point of having intrinsic motivation is not mentioned in the conversation which makes me wonder, why it was not? It was such s distinguishing factor, but he doesn’t wants to distinguish humans, so why try to mimic humans?</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/lXUZvyajciY" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Andrej Karapathy on Dwarkesh Patel Podcast</a></p><ul><li><p>I haven’t completed watching it but felt really excited to learn more about LLMs.</p></li><li><p>I like the analogy of human brain and the LLM. When we sleep we kind of reset the context window, but update our parameters, we internalise the lessons, we can think and process in the background and connect stuff up.</p></li><li><p>I also found it surprising that reaching the state of the art models with 1B parameter would take a decade or so? Kind of practical but considering the frequency of the current releases of models, it looks it could happen almost next year.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pTMvh6VzDls?si=GSEmB3KadHuv-TdD" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Rust and RAII Memory Management - Computerphile</a></p><ul><li><p>This made me clear.

Reboot, still the same.</p></li><li><p>I kept on diging the problems, and realized, I had no internet connection. I relied on WiFi, but the port was not able to work with its own 24.04 drivers. Now, this looked like a chicken and egg problem, I had to install packages, but how do I do it without internet?</p></li><li><p>Come in, ethernet, I became so dumb, I didn’t even realise that possibility.
