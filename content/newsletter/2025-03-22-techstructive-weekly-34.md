After three hectic weeks of research, hacking, scripting, implementing, Google Sheets, and Python Vulture coding an API, I made a few releases. Yes, that is the normal role of a software engineer at a startup. I get to wear multiple hats: analysing, writing, debugging, scripting, testing, and obviously communicating effectively.</p><p>I was able to complete the implementation successfully. The release somehow happened on a Friday evening, which I am skeptical about, but it happened without any hiccups, a few minor ones. It will all be well if it ends well. </p><p><span>Last weekend, I finally launched my own SSG and Blog, which I built with it. I am trying to move the site from </span><a href="https://dev.meetgor.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">meetgor.com</a><span> to </span><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">dev.meetgor.com</a><span>. The site is running on GitHub pages and is built with the Burrow SSG.</span></p><p>A week, productive, and happy about whatever I learned so far. A lot of Python scripting, with pair programming with LLMs, google Sheets for finding accuracy numbers, API shenanigans, and some serious mode all the time. I like being serious, that’s my trait, I am not bragging, just saying.</p><p>Next week, I will be hopefully writing more and uploading a video or two about some stuff that I have been tinkering with.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/159556036/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>"It’s not whether you get knocked down, it’s whether you get up." </p><p>– Vince Lombardi</p></blockquote><p>I have fallen several times, in the past few weeks, but I have always got up and kept going. It was hard, but facing guilt is more hard than the pain of falling. I can sit and cry, but that won’t get me anywhere, I am here to change my destiny, not to wait and let it unfold. I cannot change winds, but I surely can control the way I move.</p><p>Things are a bit different in tech right now, LLMs are everywhere, and they probably can do at par with a junior developer, but one thing is for sure they can’t. The curiosity, the internal fire that keeps a person alive, awake at night, forgetting the surroundings when debugging, this LLM can’t do yet! If you fall, we all do, get up and forget everything that happened, remember you can drive it, drive it better, change the way you react to failure, and  don’t let it take over you.</p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Wrote<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§wrote"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/159556036/wrote" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><p>Wrote a few things, want to write more.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://dev.meetgor.com/thoughts/zellij-open-scrollback-edit-mode/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Thoughts: Zellij Scrollback edit mode</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://dev.meetgor.com/til/format-json-in-vim-with-jq/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">TIL: Format JSON file in Vim with JQ</a></p></li></ul><p>I will be writing more since I have set up my blog at dev.meetgor.com, it is served by my own Static Site generator using Golang and Netlify Cloud Functions hosted on GitHub Pages.
