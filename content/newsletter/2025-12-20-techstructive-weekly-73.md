There was a disappointment after a glimmer of excitement when gemini 3 Flash dropped for the experiments that I was running for extraction of documents. It was maybe just the timing, but after this seeing code execution from chats, it was amazing. A good end to the work week.</p><p><span>I have continued to write Advent of SQL for the past 4 days, and brought back the streak of writing </span><a href="https://meetgor.com/sqlog" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLog</a><span>. I was not able to ship some code over the past weekend. But this weekend, I am pumped. I have time sorted out. Would be shipping some improvements in the website. Oh! I actually added snowball and particles based on season on </span><a href="meetgor.com" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">my website</a><span> (only index and post pages).</span></p><p>Last weekend, I wrote 4k words in a single day in around 3 hours. I was pumped to get all in the coming week, but only managed to get 2k words in the 5 days of the week. Struggling with consistency but trying to get hang of it. I am planning to wipe the story off this weekend, a 3-4 hour session could do it. And another goal of the year completed. I can’t be more happy. A novel, first draft at the end of 2025.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/182101506/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>Revenge may serve a purpose when it corrects injustice, but it loses its meaning when it is used only to satisfy one’s ego</p></blockquote><p>I was continuing to read the Harry potter series, this time the third “The prisoner of Azkaban”. I was observing Harry’s thoughts and his intentions, he wanted to take revenge, hinted by Malfoy, he found that intriguing and wanted to kill Serius Black without a reason. However, Sirius Black wanted to kill Peter with intentions of taking revenge for his betrayal of his friend’s trust. For a few moments, Harry’s intentions were wrong. But time(Lupin) corrected his perspective and he got on the right side. Revenge is a good thing if used with proper intention without attaching your ego and selfish interest. However when rage hits you, you loose the decision to take proper and fair actions. One needs to be capable of handling rage and directing it to a positive outcome, or letting it burn you, because to shine bright, you need to burn.</p><div><hr/></div><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/182101506/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Deliver Code you have proven to work as a software developer</a></p><ol><li><p>Right on! So true. merging slop without review, even slightly running against a manual test case can give you a good confidence and make you a good engineer.</p></li><li><p>With more code being generated and as easy as a command, it becomes rather intimidating to review code, to accept suggestion and produce more code. But code is not a magic wand its some assumptions crumpled with logical validation, both of them contradict yet when done right, creates a software that people use and breathe.</p></li><li><p>I agree to the manual as well as automated testing and LLMs will follow the pattern. If you already have tests in the codebase, it will make sure the test suite is updated when it makes a new change. There are obvious and unavoidable circumstances when you’d have to check the changes with manual test, its something that comes with the plate in the software engineering role. There is no denying in this, its a fact not an opinion.</p></li><li><p>Software and accountability is opposite side of a coin, you can’t let software account on its own, humans have bought its existence from their imaginations and manifestation, you need to validate and prove the thing you wanted to build.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/duplicate-reports" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Duplicate Reports</a></p><ol><li><p>Testing guys is the vibe of AI, testing code is becoming apparent as AI can produce code in matter of seconds.
