## Week #57

It was a fun week, really doubled down on learning SQLite and SQL. Shipped a bit of code and had fun creating improving metrics on the work side of things. Able to see 10% improvement in the things I have been working on the past few months. Really a good vibe week. I finally broke the barrier or imposter syndrome and whatever it might be called it while using the AI-assisted/vibe coding things.

### Use AI for what’s it god at: Throwaway code

I actually started to understand the areas where I need and can 100% use AI tools like throwaway scripts, CSV/JSON dumping, data extraction scripts things like that. I used Cursor-Agent to do the most of things and I was happy at the end of the day, it nearly one shot it, I had to do a few tweaks here and there but was mostly correct, nothing like starting to write the script from scratch after it giving up. It really helped me save at least half to an hour worth of work in 5 minutes almost 3 days in a row. I felt good, I don’t felt like doing that chores so nothing valuable is lost in that.

I can focus on the other priority items. So, this was a valuable lesson for me to use AI effectively where it shines, in generating shit lot of code that nobody cares but I need to get the job done, generate a few data points from sapheggeti logs and piles and oodles of data. I don’t care if it uses a list comprehension or a C-style for loop, I didn’t even bother looking at it, here readability has 0 value. So use AI to generate plots, structured data from logs, benchmarks (review the samples first though), among the other things.

I can breathe in comfort, after knowing that I develop that intuition as a developer, those things are still valuable and evergreen even if AI can spit out code, there needs to be the one who can guide it in a way to get the job done **effectively**.
