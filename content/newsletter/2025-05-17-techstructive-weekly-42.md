I am sick right now, still somehow finding the right amount of energy to pump this edition out. I have a sore throat and fever. Twitchy eyes in the cold make things worse.</p><p>But emotionally, I have been on the battlefield, it seems. The battle has started between my heart and mind. The one that cares about the craft, my soul, and the other about the ego, duties and responsibilities, fame, the thing that I am right now. It’s intense, I am barely able to breathe and think. It’s making me doubt myself, my decisions, my efforts, and my existence.</p><p>The war is not about winning, it  is about fighting; even if I were to lose, I would be happy I fought. I didn't give up, but the opponent was a bit more powerful. There will be a revenge if I loose of course, but that is the worst case scenario.</p><p>Back to tech, I have been working on VLLMs, i.e., using Visual inputs to LLMs to get things out from it. Usually for extraction, summarizing, etc. And it was not that exciting, because I feel awkward working with LLMs these days. Especially to write code, not the process of integrating, I love that, but I am kind of forced to use LLMs in doing anything at work. Kind of feels like lavish luxury to some people, but for me, it’s a curse, a way to dig your own grave. People don't realize that LLMs are making humans dumb; they are making you think less, and do tab-tab auto-complete. Not saying it’s bad, but using it all the time makes me feel empty inside.</p><p>Ah! What a time to be a junior developer. What a worse way to start your career. A bump straight away. No time to think, no time to reflect.</p><p>I think this can't be a worse time to be a software developer, at least for the one who care about the art and craft of building software. They can still find joy, but can't hold the responsibilities.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/163714534/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><span>“The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.”</span><br/><span>— Carl Jung</span></p></blockquote><p>Yes, this is tough. I might speak a bit repetitively about these things, but this is important to get it out. AI is no longer a small hype like the Web-3 boom of 2022, the  COVID pandemic lasting 2 years, it is more than that now. Chat GPT was launched in December of 2022, almost 2 years after its arrival, it has taken humans by storm.</p><p>Being able to replace your craft and art that your soul craves and loves with a machine is jarring and draining. As if there is no purpose left for humans. Yes, the quote is rightly placed for this time, at least for me. I don’t know how a developer cannot even feel a little scared after all of this. Hopefully, we will have some positive directions soon.</p><blockquote></blockquote><div><hr/></div><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/163714534/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/04/23/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-coding/?ref=dailydev" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The hidden cost of AI coding</a></p><ul><li><p>With AI and Agentic AI, we as developers are going to get very few flow state sessions.

Also, there have been discussions around me where the takeover of AI by developers was around the corner. Not even that, I am not scared of that, but the part right now, where companies and top-level managers, or whatever they are called, are forcing developers to use LLMs. They say, Why use horse carts when we have flying jets.
