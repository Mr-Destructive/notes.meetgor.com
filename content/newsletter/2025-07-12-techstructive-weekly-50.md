Also broke the 15 day long writing streak. It all just falls apart, I want to change things now. I work remotely,  and not able to balance work-life and personal life, its just too exhausting. I get self-doubt creep up with this, am I really a sustainable developer, can I not continue development for the next 10 years even? It is starting to haunt me. I know it would be temporary, imposter syndrome feeling, but need to really change the flow of my daily routine to get a mindset shift.</p><p>But learnt a lot this week, about SQL continuing from the past week, started solving SQL 50 problems, which I am halfway through. Also need to ramp up my problem solving skills, need to build projects, there is lot of stuff to do. I just get overwhelmed with stuff every time.</p><p>I haven’t streamed for the past 3 weeks and it is giving me negative cloud of procrastination. Hopefully will be able to break the jinx this weekend. July has been good to me in the past, hoping for the best again.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/168083973/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“It’s not about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.” </p><p>– Rocky Balboa</p></blockquote><p>Yes, I admit I might be hit, I have fallen, I no longer have the motivation to code for some patches of the week. But I have the spark back at times and flash of seconds. It might be a temporary burst of problems at my end, but every storm weathers out, every night ends and that’s when the comeback begins, the sun strikes and light appears, there we see a hope, and the light at the end of the tunnel, it might be small, but enough to keep moving us ahead.</p><p>I am willing to change my workflow and routine, I just need to give it some time. If habits are easy to build they are easy to break too. I know this with my 15 day writing streak that I broke, I didn’t had the mental energy to sit and write for an hour, and that’s the reason I am frustrated with my life, with my work. I am adamant to change. </p><p>By the end of July the max, the first year anniversary of this newsletter will be special one.</p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Created<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§created"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/168083973/created" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p><span>SqueaLite Browser Editor → </span><a href="https://squealite.vercel.app/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">squealite.vercel.app</a></p><ul><li><p>Just wanted a quick and easy way to write SQL queries and test out on a database.</p></li><li><p>Turns out sql.js is a great solution for it, it’s a WASM library to interact with SQL in the browser with JS.
