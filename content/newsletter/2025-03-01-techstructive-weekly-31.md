## Week #31

What a week, again, a bit of thump and bumps, a bit of scare at work.

Last week was hectic, this week was continuing that bump in increased responsibilities. I think I might be transitioning from Junior to Senior, but the mindset might be of a junior, need to step up.

Might be the first time I felt a bit pressured, making me doubt myself, negative thoughts, quitting decisions, etc are flowing in my mind. Nothing bad, just wired stuff happening in life, it’s tough to live life sometimes, its hard to show it, no one knows what you and your family is going through in life, before they lash out and ruin it further. No one has patience and empathy anymore.

See, days are bad, were good before, its just time, and it shall pass. Test of patience and my temperament, I need to focus and avoid taking a rash decision immediately. A emotion-ed mind is vulnerable to bad decisions and ruining the hard word laid off in the past. Stay calm, don’t stop, but let the storm pass, before you sense the direction, because the direction might be wrong anyways.

### Quote of the week

Life will give you moments that you think will haunt you, that time, you’ll look back and say, if only I could change that. Nope, don’t look back, reflect yes. Don’t overthink and regret, just pause, understand what went wrong, deep breathe, it’s ok we are all learning, I had done this mistake, admit and move ahead.

Life is too short, to enjoy the past ride, enjoy the current landscape, AI, LLMs, AI Agents, Model Context Protocol, so many things to learn. Don’t corner yourself and feel restrictive about mistakes or disappointments, think about what excites you, get that habbit and embrace it.
