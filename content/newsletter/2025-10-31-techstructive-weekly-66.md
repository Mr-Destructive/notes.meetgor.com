<p></p><h2>Week #66</h2><p>It was a silent week, chipping away the days like wasted days. I didn&#8217;t do much, honestly, it was tiring and draining. I spent the weekend outside, had a few chores to complete, and didn&#8217;t quite get the time to sit at peace. This weekend too, looks the same. Post Diwali rituals, guests, and functions. </p><p>I have long left the SQLog to decay, but I intend to pick it back up from tomorrow. Lot of things to do, little mental energy left.</p><p></p><h3>Quote of the week</h3><blockquote><p>You do not just wake up and become the butterfly, Growth is a process.&#8221;</p><p>&#8213; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8846698-you-do-not-just-wake-up-and-become-the-butterfly">Rupi Kaur, The Sun and Her Flowers</a></p></blockquote><p>Some days, are harsh, slow, even boring. You have to keep pusing through. You can&#8217;t start flying the moment you are a butterfly, you&#8217;ll fall, scamper and pick yourself up. How interesting and inspiring it is. In a moment, nature teaches us so many things. Its not about how many times we fail, its about the moment we realize what we were missing and now we have it, its not about why we didn&#8217;t have it, what we did to achieve it. That is the separation from knowledge to wisdom.</p><p></p><h2>Read</h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://larrysanger.org/2025/10/grokipedia-a-first-look/">Grokipedia: A first look</a></p><ol><li><p>I really like the post. It was a balanced take on the new hyped LLM site. It looks good, maybe it serves a purpose, but still, that 1% of the search I am doing I want to be 100% sure, not 101% confidently wrong.</p></li><li><p>We don&#8217;t know what this will do to the learning and knowledge bowl of humans, but it might have an impact, good or bad. It's a pivotal moment in internet history. We are either full-on AI or superhumans.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://marvinh.dev/blog/building-from-first-principles/">Building from First Principles</a></p><ol><li><p>Agreed. Jargon creates back and forth between people. It leads to more confusion and bugs. Make it simple, you don&#8217;t need a 10-document-long API spec, a simple line can serve the purpose if the intention and the why is clear.</p></li><li><p>Keep it simple and studpid, this is a well known advice and it should be injested in AI workflows, they create bloat and make it impossible to review the complex tree of code.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://www.piglei.com/articles/en-why-is-python-ordereddict-ordered/">Why Python&#8217;s OrderedDict maintain the order</a></p><ol><li><p>This is nice. It makes sense now. Using two pieces of data structure, the doubly linked list to maintain the order and the dictionary for the ease of access. Balancing both the requirements swiftly.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/sabbaticals-keep-our-attrition-at-bay-9ccba5c0">Sabbaticals keep our attrition at bay</a></p><ol><li><p>A six week, almost one and a half month break, that is a huge one.</p></li><li><p>I don&#8217;t like breaks, maybe it might be necessary in some point of time in someones life, the situation might demand it. But just because you have the option, I don&#8217;t like taking it. I think forcing yourself to work brings you the skill of consistency and trust. </p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/10/24/code-like-a-surgeon">Code like a surgeon</a></p><ol><li><p>Knowing what to hand off and what to roll your sleeves . Knowing that is cirtical. I think it comes off from experience and time, you will fail in making decisions, but it would make you aware what you are capable of and what will take time.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/">It's insulting to read your AI-generated blog post</a></p><ol><li><p>I will never ever try to use AI in writing. Becuase I want to think, otherwise what is the purpose of doing anything. If humans just hand off every bit of things to AI what is the moat of humans?</p></li><li><p>What is the advantage of having a big brain. Its like having two queens on the chess board and still not able to checkmate. Skill issues.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://bytesauna.com/post/coding-vs-software-engineering">AI can write code, but can&#8217;t build software</a></p><ol><li><p>They just don&#8217;t write code, they vomit and throw code at you. To review.</p></li><li><p>It can&#8217;t develop intuition for what to debug, what to test for. It will do whatever it takes to make it work, it could even mean to delete the test and change the code to pass the test. Keep it away from your zone.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p></p><h2>Watched</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/VgtfpTGJmHQ">Cursor 2.0: It just changed forever</a></p><ul><li><p>This is fast, blazingly fast. The model I don&#8217;t know but the speed is truly fast.

I have never used the .md files for AI Agents, it doesn&#8217;t listen to the main prompt. How can it listen and adhere to the other file prompts?
