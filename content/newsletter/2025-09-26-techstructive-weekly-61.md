I tried my best to be a backend developer but was not worthy of being one, I was stranded as a product developer. I am not saying I hate being a product developer, it just gets too menial and boring once you know the limitations and the quirks of a product.</p><p>Apart from the grill, I learnt a lot about tokenization. I also continued to write occasionally about SQLite in the SQLog, three more entries. Wasn’t able to livestream due to guests and was unwell for the weekend with cold.</p><p>Read a lot as usual, still keeping out from the doom-scrolling spiral. It is helping me on the mental level, but need to find something in life that will push me without looking for other things constantly. Maybe my work is not helping me here, its barely keeping me in peace, need to find a switch as fast as possible, the job market is not what you want to be in.</p><p>Let’s see being conscious and specific about life is getting important and need to take some actions to lift my spirits up.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/174624127/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><em>“A home isn’t always the house we live in. It’s also the people we choose to surround ourselves with.”</em></p><p>— From the book “The House in the Cerulean Sea” by T.J. Klune</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>I completed reading the book and felt deeply satisfied and cozy. What a book, hits hard, hits home. The way it presents dull and boring life into a beautiful narrative for a transformation. The lessons of empathy and kindness, being a human is so important in today’s age. Sorry, this is not a book review, but getting into the specific of this quote is grounded in the story.</p><p>The main character finds his new home which once he thought would just be a part of his job to do the needful for a month. A home is not something you just live in, its a relation with the people you make, the care each other makes, the choices and memories we make is what make a home, family.</p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Created<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§created"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/174624127/created" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><p>Continued to write more about SQLite, not quite continuously.

It has a lot of knowledge to get that number but just sheer looking at the tokens, it can’t. </p></li><li><p>The other example of adding less tokens is that we might have a lot of tokens for a given content and we might run of out context window to process the request. This is true for languages other than English, LLMs aren’t good at that the earlier ones especially as the tokenisation for those was not optimized or had fewer tokens due to selection of dataset.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>SQLite</p><ul><li><p>Create temporary tables, the temporary table is actually stored in the temp location file and in a separate database. </p></li><li><p><span>If you had two tables with the same name one as the primary permanent table and other as the temporary table, if you just refer the table name, the temporary table will be preferred over the permanent.
