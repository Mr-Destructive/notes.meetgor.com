However, life is pushing me in a different direction, and I am so confused. I have responsibilities to perform and situations to tackle. It is a bit hard to live ahead, but I will stay with my three pillars: curiosity, consistency, and grit. </p><p>This week, I created one video, and that’s it. It was just a bit of a hectic weekend, so I didn’t have much free time. However, on weekdays, I was able to learn about subdomains, LLMs, and more. I read a lot about writing, and at this point, I am overwhelmed with writing advice. I think it is high time to write consistently. </p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/156682557/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><span>“</span><br/><span>Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.</span><br/><span>”  </span><br/><span>— Gail Devers</span></p></blockquote><p>I feel a bit overwhelmed as to what should I be doing, I have so many things going on:</p><ul><li><p>100 Days of Golang (38 articles completed)</p></li><li><p>Youtube Channel (~50 subscribers) | 20 videos</p></li><li><p>Writing Novels (soo many ideas, overwhelmed to start on one)</p></li></ul><p>Each idea requires some intense planning and execution steps, however, I work full-time as a software developer, which is also a mentally draining process. Managing all of these things at once will burn me out instantly, but have kept pace for the past 6 months, and continue to do so. However, I want to make it a bit structured and habitual rather than a hap-hazard way of poking everything at once, which ends up having nothing accomplished and still burned out.</p><p>I took that quote and rambled, but I need to pick direction now, I have a sense of speed, but the direction is more important here. I will be analyzing where I will be heading this year this week.</p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Created<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§created"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/156682557/created" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-uNWDCr9mMk?si=ek92CeDVpa2h9wfC" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Turso CLI Guide</a><span>: Interacting with LibSQL databases on the Turso platform</span></p><ul><li><p><span>I just created the first video on ShotCut tool, a local video editor.

This will rapidly evolve in my opinion with LLMs writing the code and at some point, the backend will just be a black box that is hardly touched with code, just a few knobs and switches to make changes.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://jarosz.dev/article/how-to-write-better-tests-in-go/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">How to write better tests in Go</a><span>: This was a nice overview of how to structure tests and the mindset of writing test cases.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.stackademic.com/top-10-clean-code-rules-831fb34caff7" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Top 10 Clean Code Rules</a><span>: This was also an insightful read, specifically writing the positive conditionals instead of negative ones is so relatable and correct in many ways.
