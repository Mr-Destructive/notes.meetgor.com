Its been 3 months now, the first sparkle was created and now I think its  high time to take the big decision. It’s no longer rash, but it’s a long thought decision.</p><p>Anyways, I don’t want to talk about it. Let’s see in the next few weeks where the wind take me.</p><p>I explored the AI Agents by creating a local agent in Python from scratch with the Meta AI LLM. It was a fun one, list, read, and edit files tools provided, I also wanted to add shell command execution. Will be doing it next weekend. Also had explored the LLM-plugin for Meta AI LLM wrapper.</p><p></p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/165354257/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>"We were born in order to see and listen to the world.

That dopamine hit is why I code.</p></blockquote><p>I have talked about it previously, and it resonates with me too. I haven’t tried it to the extreme yet. But this is what it is supposed to be doing, if done and used correctly.</p></li><li><p>Caring about the craft is what the author rightly meant to keep LLM out of the loop. He compares with the woodworking; if you treat woodworking as a hobby, then you should care about the tiny details and fine refinements. That is not something for LLM to take care.</p></li><li><p>Junior level output of these LLM is a bit scary. It makes juniors a place of bother. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AI changes everything</a></p><ul><li><p>Everyone seems to be positive about AI, I am not against it, its good, but its moving too fast.</p><blockquote><p>I encourage you not meet that moment with cynicism or fear: meet it with curiosity, responsibility and the conviction that this future will be bright and worth embracing.</p></blockquote></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://blog.anniesexton.com/AI-is-rotting-my-brain-203b150f3dfa80d89d5dcee47c79fecd" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AI is rotting my brain</a></p><ul><li><p>“We couldn’t stop making art even if we tried,” that hit me, it makes me feel alive and have purpose in life again.</p></li><li><p>Yes, learning about LLM and how it is working is super fun, its quite interesting and rewarding. Then that makes the point that LLMs are not bad, it’s the adoption by people that matters.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://lemmy.ml/post/30100312?ref=dailydev" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">My Engineering Craft regressed</a></p><ul><li><p>This is literally me. I can completely get the words of the person. Its exciting to work on side projects and contribute to open source projects, but really no one cares, but I have done it so far for personal pleasure.</p></li><li><p>If something makes me learn new things and go from knowing nothing to fixing a bug, the feeling of finally being able to go through that and see the green tick is so satisfying that the “who cares” question is just out of the equation. The feeling cannot be compared with anything.</p></li><li><p>I also feel a bit sluggish when solving LeetCode, I hate it for some reason. I have barely done any problems on leetcode, let alone grind it for weeks and months. I don’t quite understand the purpose of it. Just to get the job? To improve problem-solving skills? Maybe, but that’s just not how my brain likes to solve problems; my brain works when it sees the problem.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://vishnubharathi.codes/blog/first-user-framework" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">First User Framework</a></p><ul><li><p>If there is no user, that is not a solution; it is a problem you are inventing yourself.</p></li><li><p>If you are developing something for yourself, don’t do it right away. If you have the time and capacity to keep up with the learning and work-life balance, then do it without thinking. But if you are already burnt out, maybe just don’t, it might lead you nowhere.</p></li><li><p>If you have one user, start building it. If you have at least a user, there is already a feedback loop developed once you build it. The instant feedback input and the validation part makes it addictive.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://cassidoo.co/post/input-type-date/?ref=dailydev" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Styling the icons for HTML date and time types: Cassidy Williams Blog</a></p><ul><li><p>This was a specific tip, but goes on to make me understand the input types are so rich in HTML.
