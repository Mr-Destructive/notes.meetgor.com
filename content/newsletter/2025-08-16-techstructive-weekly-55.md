Saturday was Raksha Bandhan, so almost half of the day was spent in those rituals and getting in and out of the house and guests.</p><p>Sunday was mundane as I just sat back and took a break to detox the technical things I have been doing over that last week. Then hard hitting monday came where I was frustrated with AI vibes, that left me a headache and sore throat for the next day. Took a leave for the day and was feeling better on Wednesday, cradled a few more vibe coding sessions, this time more focused on my code expertise and drove the LLM to do certain things in certain limited ways, and it worked better.</p><p>The tuesday bit is what gave me a little relief, I just layed back and slept for the most of the day, I had minor headache and throat was sore in the morning part. I just didn’t pick up my phone or the laptop till late evening and felt calm and human again. I think I can say humans need to have a digital detox day once a week or months to develop their brains again in this AI-dominated world.</p><p>Regarding learning more SQL, I took this week off. I think I need some time to accept all the things I have learnt and start a fresh next week. This is something I read somewhere that your brain needs time to retain information, too much information dump makes it harder to remember and connect things. Slow down the input and let the output process itself.</p><p>I almost completed the before the coffee gets cold series, the 5 book series, and I haven’t complained an inch so far. The meaning conveyed is heart touching, and it has given me a reason to exist and life among this frustrations and melancholics of life.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/171042204/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“If we let everyone who dies to be a cause of unhappiness, that would mean people are being born to become unhappy, but people are always born for the sake of happiness“</p><p>— Toshikazu Kawaguchi from “Before your Memory Fades”</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11964656-something-i-strongly-believe-is-that-we-mustn-t-allow-the" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">LINK</a></p></blockquote><p>I read this book, and man! this quote hits home in the end. It just changed the way of my thinking about life and my loved ones. It gave me a reason to exist (among AI doom and gloom), it gave me a reason to be myself and choose being happy over sad.</p><p>If life gave you an option to choose anger over empathy, always choose empathy, this is also on the similar lines. If you have choice to be happy or sad, be happy, because that is what we are here for. Why be sad and live life like a zombie, like a AI chat bot without a true purpose and inner fire? Live life like a smiling and let that happiness spread and remove negativity.</p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/171042204/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://blog.remote-mcp.com/p/the-grug-brained-ai-developer-an-e3a" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Grug brained AI developer: LLM Appendix</a></p><blockquote><p>LLM worst when grug not know answer and hope LLM figure out.</p><p>this important distinction! many grug not understand!</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>That made me laugh hard, not gonna lie.

Please, use AI I don’t refrain it, but everything has its moderation and area of use. AI for ART is pointless and gives existential crisis, refrain, I am not sure where it could be used without a thought blindly.

This never ending social media has made us brain want more and more, so we need to bring that fun and content (satisfaction) in content back.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://www.deepintodev.com/blog/how-react-works-behind-the-scenes?ref=dailydev" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">How React works behind the scenes (under the hood)</a></p><ol><li><p>Wow!

There is a graph created so that it becomes easier to distinguish and make a hierarchy of the app. The virtual DOM as called is like the graph that helps in re-rendering, but the heavy lifting is done by the Fiber tree (which is a lower level abstraction) that does the actual replacement or rendering technique algorithms.</p></li><li><p>The process is so quick that the magic is not even noticable, but yes that is one rabbit hole to dig into.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://hugo.insanelogs.xyz/posts/hugo-pipeline/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Hugo + Obsidian + Git Pipeline</a></p><ol><li><p>This blog gave me a idea to simplify my static site generator, instead of syncing with the database from github, I can just simply use a sqlite file and sync to the database an vice versa.
