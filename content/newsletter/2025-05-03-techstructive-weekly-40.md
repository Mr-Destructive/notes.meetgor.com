## Week #40

What a week, I knew the silence was just temporary, it would come at once, thankfully it was not too much releases to keep track of. There was, however, one release of a model (or a family of models) from Alibaba Cloud with the Qwen suite of models, that overthrew the Meta AI LLama Models from the SOTA standard for open source models.

This week, I explored a bit about LLMs and how to operate with them effectively, thanks to the prompt engineering masterclass from Anthropic. I created a bunch of things, leaving aside my fear and procrastination. This week, I was a bit self-critical of myself but was able to break through the chains and took some hard decisions and executed, the results? Not sure, maybe good, might not work. But that is not in my hands; whatever was, is done. Time to move ahead and explore this AI revolution firsthand.

I want to do this and this, nope, that might be output oriented

Let’s try to explore this and this, what might we need to do, what we need to go through to feel this?  
That is the question that is answered in a process-oriented way.

I want to change this, and I have been reading the book, Tiny Experiments, so far it has changed quite a few things about my procrastination behaviour and helped me take action over being scared or fretting over the perfectionism bug.
