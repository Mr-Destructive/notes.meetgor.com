Didn’t get much time to just sit and think, just had to complete a few hacks here and there to get the demo running, poor management and blind eyeing.</p><p>I am a bit stressed at the moment, not able to do anything, occupied in work from 9 to 12. Yes, that is a bit stressful and hectic to carry this daily.</p><p>Just raw thoughts in the start, feels a bit embarrassing but it is the reality. Have not uploaded a video since 4 weeks, will be 5th week this weekend if not uploaded. I am not worried about the number but I am trying to say how life is playing with me currently.</p><p>Too bad to be true.</p><p>I learnt a lot, not saying no to that, but at what cost? My entire week? This is what I do 24x7 apart from 8 hours of sleep? Maybe not.Its hard to answer and take a decision at the moment, since my only responsibility is to lift myself out of some situation.</p><p>Enough ramble, I did a lot of llm prompts, python all over.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/158587949/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><em>"The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do."</em><span> </span><br/><span>– B.F. Skinner</span></p></blockquote><p>At this juncture, I might not think, but I should have context on what to do. Figuring out the actual problem from the fuss, and then boiling that down to simple technical problems is something I need to work on. I realized this a lot over the past couple of weeks.</p><p>LLMs can think provided the human had did a bit of thinking at first. It is just going to predict the next word or code, based on what is already there in the internet, however some things are created of pure intuition and wisdom that is the one that will set someone apart from others.</p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/158587949/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://toddle.dev/blog/why-is-everyone-trying-to-replace-software-engineers" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Why is everyone trying to replace software engineers</a><span>: I had my first meeting where there were clients, actual users of the product. And I was a technical guy so not much needed for me to talk just demo the things, went a bit technical and in a jiffy but thats it, I think we will be replaced with the people who can understand the business better and not by any LLM.

But the counter point to that would be, how to know if the thing we are copying is actually good, that sense need to be developed and I think that comes with time and experience and mistakes.</span></p><p></p></li></ul><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Watched<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§watched"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/158587949/watched" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><p>Really didn’t had much time to watch anything.
