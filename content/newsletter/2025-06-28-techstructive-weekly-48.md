I failed a few times, and even my network seems to be off for a while, so I had to scrape that idea and stop streaming for the weekend. So, it didn’t quite work out. Instead this weekend I’ll only stream on Saturday to start one project.</p><p>I read and consumed a lot of stuff this week. I need to be creating and writing more too. The balance is essential.</p><p>I will share one small achievement and progress on my non-tech journey. I wrote 8,000 words approximately on one my Novel (or novella I don’t know yet). I wrote consistently for a week, 1 hour every day, averaging of 1200 words per day. A good start I think, better late then never. I have been procrastinating this for quite some time, in terms of years now. Finally Friday, 20th June 2025 was the day I beat that devil and my hear finally won. It looks small, on the out, but I think this is a start of something big. A turn that I want to remember when I reflect back on my life.</p><p></p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/166981993/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><span>“The thing that you are most resisting is probably the thing you most need to do.”</span><br/><span>— </span><em>Steven Pressfield, The War of Art</em></p></blockquote><p>I have read the book, the war of art, and this quote speaks to me like fire. Something has resisted me from getting into fantasy and creative writing. But here I am after a week of writing consistently. I feel liberated and joyed. There is so much to do, too little time, too many pages to fill, too many characters to paint, too many stories to tell and most importantly so many lives to be kindled with writing.</p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Created<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§created"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/166981993/created" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p>LLM plugin for code agent with Code toolbox</p></li><li><p>Tried to create a reader app for collecting and reading articles or content</p><ul><li><p>Like Mozilla’s Pocket, but focused on reading individual as well collected resources in a simplified interface, distraction free reading</p></li><li><p>I get a lot of articles to read, sometimes, I get lost in between tabs and to be read articles, so I wanted to create a simple that lets me dump links to it and later I can skim through them for reading with a simple interface for reading.</p></li></ul><p></p></li></ul><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/166981993/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/23/phoenix-new/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Pheonix. new Fly’s entry for AI coding agents</a></p><ul><li><p>This is a neat little thing from fly.io, they have made everything so right, that these AI Agents just fit perfectly in their ecosystem.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/using-ai-right-now-a-quick-guide" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Using AI right now: A quick guide</a></p><ul><li><p>Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude these are the most widely adopted LLMs which are quite general purpose.
