Surely there won’t be time gains, but they now have a lot more control over what needs to be changed and included while adding more or even upstreaming from SQLite-core. People might call re-writing a waste of time (especially for such a well-developed and stable tool), but people forget they are making something from scratch gives you a whole different depth of understanding than just forking it. It will pay dividends slowly in the long run, pulling from upstream might be challenging and tedious but since SQLite is rock-solid, there won’t be any breaking changes that might get added to it, so a win-win for Turso in my opinion.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ashu1461.com/interview-gone-wrong/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Interview gone wrong: Python tidbit</span><br/></a><span>This was just a small tidbit that the author is trying to make here and I kind of agree, python has syntax sugar and gets too abstracted while doing some dangerous pointer things.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/12/02/a-revolution-in-how-robots-learn" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">A Revolution in how robots learn</a><span> (40-minute read)</span><br/><span>I read it on a Sunday morning and I was just in awe with the writing and the flow of one example to other.

However, the essence is to store the computed value for the later stage, where there are clear-cut rules or defined behavior of the computation required to do certain things.</span><br/><span>In the context of this problem, we have to check how many stones will be there at the end of 25 blinks, basically at each blink, there are certain rules like if there is a stone numbered 0, it changes to 1, there is one more rule and you can check the whole question </span><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/11" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span>. It can be solved using a map where we know a stone number can be split into n number of stones, so we use that when we encounter that number in the future and don’t re-compute it again.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Use structs instead of a list of integers for coordinates, please</strong></p><p><span>I am solving advent of code problems in golang, and gosh I have wasted so much time using a slice of integers instead of creating structs, the code shouts to use it, but reluctant elitist me refrained from doing it and went with the flow and ended up messing up gazillions of time index of x with y and yes it was a skill issue.</span><br/><span>I WILL USE THE STRUCT </span><code>type point struct {x int; y int}</code><span> INSTEAD OF THIS DAMN THING </span><code>[]int{}</code><span> .</span></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">df to_json is a handy way to dump a data frame</a></strong><span> when looking for something very minute or finding some pattern</span></p><p><span>I discovered that </span><code>df.to_json</code><span> is a function available to dump out a data frame to a JSON file which is quite nice and handy.
