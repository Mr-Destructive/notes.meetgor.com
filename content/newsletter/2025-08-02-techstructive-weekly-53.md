I watched and read a lot of resources on SQL, databases and backend in general. I want to understand SQL to learn what is the fundamental unit in CRUD apps, which I think is a SQL query. </p><p>Writing SQL query by hand in 2025 might be obsolete, but that 2% or 5% of the queries are pain in the ass to get LLMs write, that’s when the knowledge the depth, the legs of the PI shaped learning helps and make you feel alive, after weeks of existential crisis. I’ll keep learning SQL for the time being.</p><p>Admitting that I didn’t push any code to prod this week, it was a bit of struggle for me to get things in shape after loosing touch, I did a ton of debugging, but didn’t push any code. I’ll be honest about it, as there are days where you are just a helping hand or a gazing at the things unfold before you, because it’s ain’t my time or space to do it. Next week, probably will be breaking prod.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/169845799/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“Without your involvement you can’t succeed. With your involvement you can’t fail.”</p><p>— APJ Abdul Kalam</p></blockquote><p>Immerse yourself in the process, because you can’t win without, and the only thing in the way is yourself. I have involved myself in programming completely for 3 years, and have not failed in a literal sense, I have a great job, have good motivation to work towards, yes I made mistakes and continue to learn from them and make more different ones, that’s the process. If you put out, you know, you learn, you get better, the more you put out, the more luck doubles up each time.</p><p>Most people get exhausted after the upteenth attempt, but they might be just one more step away from success, success should never be the only goal, if it is, what after you achieve it? The process, the madness to do it, should be, the curiosity that will flicker in the toughest of times will carry the weakest to the peaks and the absence of it can make the strongest tumble down the cliff. </p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Created<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§created"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/169845799/created" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p>Wrote</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/til/tmux-scroll-mode-select-and-copy/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">TIL: TMUX Scroll mode select and copy</a></p><ul><li><p>I was in dilemma, I sometimes use Ghostty or default terminal, sometimes with multiple windows, sometimes different tabs, sometimes zellij and sometimes tmux.</p></li><li><p>I just forced myself to use TMUX and ended on the problems or flows that I have been avoiding to fix,failing to find and navigate around like a wizard, but took a few minutes to get the mess out, and here we go.</p></li><li><p><span>This was just a few key strokes away namely, </span><code>prefix + [ </code><span>to enter the scroll mode, Ctrl + Space to enter selection mode, and Enter or Ctrl + J to copy to clipboard.
