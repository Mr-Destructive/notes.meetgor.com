<h2>Week #74</h2><p>It was winding down week, 2025, ending slowly, the biggest irony. The year was full of fast-paced, unprecedented models just dropping here and there. It was hard to keep up with the progress. It was getting overwhelming, no one is used to such a level of information. I was dreading with so much power in our hands. I couldn&#8217;t handle it and refrained it and thought it was better to focus on learning new things. I kept using AI tools at work, not by choice, but initially through force but then through necessity. </p><p>People made developers go fast, but they realised, </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://ordep.dev/posts/writing-code-was-never-the-bottleneck">Churning code was never the bottleneck</a></p></li><li><p>Solving problems and understanding the business needs was the core goal.</p></li></ul><p>Yet, people thought and here we are with tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and 10 other CLI tools. I learnt the hard way to leverage this tools, to use only when the code was throw away, some scripts, and getting insights from logs. But never on actual bugs and features, it was draining, lacked the joy I get from actually making it.</p><p>So, at the end of 2025, I am a decent developer who cannot use AI tools. Yes! give or take, I would love to learn more in 2026. </p><h3>Quote of the week</h3><div class="callout-block" data-callout="true"><p><strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fear a future with AI. I fear a present without thinking.&#8221;</strong></p></div><p>Yes! That is what I believe in this year. I have stopped thinking it seems. If in 2026, we move very fast without thinking, I need to change for the better. The directions we take, everything is a decision, but on what ground, on what thought. If the thought are not 90% yours, you are not thinking enough.</p><p>Think, don&#8217;t let AI do it.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Created</h2><ul><li><p>Advent of SQL 2025 in SQLite</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/advent-of-sql-2025-day-11">Day 11: Behavior Score</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/advent-of-sql-2025-day-10">Day 10: Misdelivered Presents</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/advent-of-sql-2025-day-9">Day 9: Evergreen Market Orders</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/advent-of-sql-2025-day-8">Day 8: Product Catalog</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/advent-of-sql-2025-day-7">Day 7: Polar Express Mixin</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/advent-of-sql-2025-day-6">Day 6: Days of Delight</a> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/advent-of-sql-2025-day-5">Day 5: EchoTrack Wrapped</a></p></li></ul></li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>Read</h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://neilthanedar.com/youre-not-burnt-out-youre-existentially-starving/">You&#8217;re not burning out, you&#8217;re essentially starving</a></p><ul><li><p>This was a good one</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>When you truly chase your highest potential, everything you thought was burnout will melt away.</strong> Because you weren&#8217;t suffering from too much work, you were suffering from too little truly important work. Like a boy who thought he was full until dessert arrives, you&#8217;ll suddenly find your hunger return!</p></blockquote><p>Some really good points</p><blockquote><p>Pause once a month to make sure you&#8217;re still on the right track. Stop once a year to triple-check you&#8217;re on the right track. But never get off this path towards your highest potential. Anything else will starve you existentially</p></blockquote><p>This is true</p><blockquote><p><strong>We&#8217;re optimizing for less suffering instead of more meaning.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Yes</p><blockquote><p><strong>I woke up today so excited to get to work thinking it was Monday morning already.</strong> Instead of jumping right into it, I spent all morning making breakfast and playing with my kids, then wrote this post. When I&#8217;m writing about something personal, 1,000+ words can easily flow for me in an afternoon.</p></blockquote><p>Just read the post!</p></li><li><p><a href="https://armeet.bearblog.dev/becoming-the-machine/">Don&#8217;t become the machine</a></p><ol><li><p>This is well put.</p></li><li><p>I kind of hate this argument.</p></li><li><p>Why are we comparing ourselves to machines in the first place? We can grind, but with thinking what actually we are doing.</p></li><li><p>Because I equate grind to consistency, it sometimes feels like grind, and we need to overcome that emotion of letting it overtake us. But most of the days, the grind is a joy, we do it because we feel like doing it.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://zhach.news/how-i-left-youtube/">How I left youtube</a></p><ol><li><p>Man that was a good read!</p></li><li><p>I resonated with this a lot</p><div class="callout-block" data-callout="true"><p> This duality is exhausting. It forces you to lie by omission to people you respect. You can&#8217;t tell your team, &#8220;I can&#8217;t take that ticket because I need to study dynamic programming.&#8221; You just have to work faster.</p></div><p>I respect people above and behind me, but I too needed to move in life, support the things I was responsible for, get out of the grave situation I was pushed into. For that, I took some decisions, which I tried for, but nothing came off it, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure about the switch and left it when the offer came. Stranded here. I am feeling good here, but if I am not in another company by the end of 2026, something is wrong with me.</p><p>Let&#8217;s see!</p></li><li><p>Good lessons</p><div class="callout-block" data-callout="true"><ul><li><p> Don&#8217;t say: &#8220;I tweaked the YouTube watch-time algorithm using X variable.</p></li></ul><p>&#8221;</p><ul><li><p>Do say: &#8220;I optimized a high-throughput distributed system to prioritize user retention metrics, reducing latency by 150ms through a custom caching layer.&#8221;</p></li></ul></div><p> </p><p>Man!!</p><div class="callout-block" data-callout="true"><p> My final conversation with my manager was heart-wrenching.
