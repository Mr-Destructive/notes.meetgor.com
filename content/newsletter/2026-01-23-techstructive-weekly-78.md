And this week is that one, the one that you need to put breaks and not reflect that’s done, but see the road ahead, not how far we have come, but where to go next. What to do next, why build something, why spent 2 years on something. Question, think, understand and let it settle. Everyone is doing that. Some aren’t privileged as I am, I am grateful for that.</p><p>I am going into the long 3 day weekend with a lot of projects to build, would be disappointing to not have at least one hack from the shed on Tuesday.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/185549798/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p><span>“I carve things of wood because things made by effort are more real than things made by wishing.”</span><br/><span>― Katherine Arden, </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/55059498" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Girl in the Tower</a></p></blockquote><p>Oh yes! This hits. I read the book last week and completed the trilogy yesterday. The quote hits home. Why? Just compare the hand crafted, effort rich written code with AI generated code. I guess I don’t have to speak anything more. The rest is on your own right? You can express you feelings about one or the other. It just is similar, but maybe incorrect. Code is a means to an end, just like some tools in our lives are. If I am a writer, laptop or a book is a means to an end, I can’t obsess one over other. I would use either whichever is at my disposal.</p><p>Effort and wishing would come in to play when you are doing it for your or others pleasure and to express something which wishing or words couldn’t.</p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/185549798/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.caimito.net/en/blog/2025/12/07/the-recurring-dream-of-replacing-developers.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The recurring dream of replacing developers</a></p><ol><li><p>what a flashback, everything makes sense.</p></li><li><p>Programming is not mechanical</p></li><li><p>yet people tried hard to make solve for it as it was mechanical</p></li><li><p>COBOL made syntax readable. CASE tools eliminated typing. Visual tools eliminated syntax. AI can now generate entire functions from descriptions</p></li><li><p>Each advancement addressed a real friction point. Yet the fundamental challenge persists because it’s not mechanical. It’s intellectual. Software development is thinking made tangible</p></li><li><p>Just sheer facts those two.

Very relatable. We all have started with some quick competence at something in the beginning and then ignored or abandon after some familiarity of it.</p></li><li><p>This exactly lists why we do that, and the reason is that going beyond that beginner competence is a steep learning curve, initially you are fast but then quickly hit a wall.</p></li><li><p>Most of them give up, the ones that stick, are the ones that somewhat develop a mastery or sort of craftsmanship in the art.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Welcome to Gas Town</a></p><ol><li><p>Agents as code generation orchestrators. This is quite a ambitious thing. I haven’t read the full post. But I can see where it goes.</p></li><li><p>I haven’t either been in situations with 10s of these agents ripping in the background. There are reasons for them and some of them I am trying to overcome.</p><ol><li><p>I don’t have that many ideas honestly, this is flawed in my opinion, my biggest weakness maybe.</p></li><li><p>I don’t have claude code as I don’t have much to spend on AI. I am limited by free options and some work related subscriptions. I am bogged down by the clumsy free models.</p></li><li><p>The habit of abandoning a project after the setup is too evasive now. The earlier habit has just got more notorious with AI.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>That all said, I love this idea, the next step in AI is agents orchestration. Maybe I am behind it, but I had a few ideas, not exactly this but some level of parallel agents running. Not orchestrating. Maybe that idea is speaking more than ever. I thought someone solved it, but nope. Need to roll up the sleeves.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/the-bet-on-juniors-just-got-better" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The bet on juniors just got better</a></p><ol><li><p>This is fair. The bet on junior aka me was that I will take the ownership. And this previous year I did. They might have gotten the payback but not quite like AI. The thing that AI might miss is reliability. Not availability.</p></li><li><p>If something goes wrong, I can wake up and roll in. But if some non-informed developer or AI does it, there it could get into a different rabbit hole.</p></li><li><p>I think the more quickly you can show your eagerness to solve problem, actual user problems the better the bet payoff would be. Its not rocket science but is easier said than done.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://atlas9.dev/blog/soft-delete.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The challenges of soft delete</a></p><ol><li><p>Nice read. I had experienced it in my first internship. This problem of dead objects. Especially if you are using Django and Postgres. It looked easy to add a field of soft deletion. But the resulting queries could create bottlenecks.</p></li><li><p>Since then I haven’t quite gotten the chance to explore this, this article showed me the different ways to implement the soft deletion.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-toil-of-blog-art" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The toil of blog art</a></p><ol><li><p>Yes, the art of expressing some concept is valuable. AI might have eased it, but true human-eque art is impossible to replicate. The chef’s kiss is what the author is trying to meld in the post about.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://susam.net/writing-first-tooling-second.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Writing first tooling second</a></p><ol><li><p>True, gold. This is to the point and another way of saying, “Show, don’t tell”, so “Write, don’t setup”</p></li><li><p>The blog is merely one possible organising principle, not a requirement.</p></li><li><p>I started the same way. I picked up hashnode, then moved to jekyll and github pages, then used python via markata (waylon walker’s ssg), an ssg that someone else wrote and I loved it, it was what I needed, the control of what goes in and out and also it was easy to see what was happening so that I can change and remove what I wanted.</p></li><li><p>I finally now am rolling my own SSG in Golang and a CMS system. I am not very consistent in sticking to one cms, I have built 3-4 versions of them. But the thing is I still post consistently. Not long form posts, but these reflective posts and short bursts of thinking.</p></li><li><p>Write your brain out first, then eventually it will outgrow to your needs, the system will be formed not shoved in. Like earlier I just used to write long form how-to-guides or tutorials, then I started to write reflections weekly, then link posts tils and suddenly I had 10 types of posts. Article, Tutorials, TILs, Thoughts, Link-blog, Newsletter, Notes, and what not.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://philipotoole.com/why-talking-to-llms-has-improved-my-thinking/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Why talking to LLMs have improved my thinking</a></p><ol><li><p>I like the take here. The one aspect of it only.</p></li><li></li></ol></li></ol><blockquote><p>Writing has always done this for me. What is different is the speed</p></blockquote><ol><li><ul><li><p>That sentence just changed my perspective on LLMs. I was skeptical but now, since they have gotten the powers of thinking, tool calling, I think they are good at talking out ideas and forming maps of different features.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://susam.net/nested-code-fences.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Nested code fences in Markdown</a></p><ol><li><p>This is clever. Never knew this.</p></li><li><p>I think this clears the rule of when to escape the backticks and the fenced code block within one. Really nice to know this. Helps in writing as well as developing a SSG.</p></li></ol></li></ol><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Watched<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§watched"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/185549798/watched" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wjnV6F2arc" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Amp Inc.
