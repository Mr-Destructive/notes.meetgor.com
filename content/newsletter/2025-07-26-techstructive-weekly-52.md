I / We were able to make the client happy after having gone through hundreds of issues and wired experiments. I was involved when the bug was introduced, but I had clarified that is this what we want, and at that time the answer was yes! Still in the end I was the one biting teeth and on the burn.</p><p>Anyways, at least the problem got solved and we were saved.</p><p>I read a ton about SQL and SQLite this week. Want to more this week too. I have a few ideas and issues that I am finding interest to work towards and finally at the end of the week or weekend will have something to share.</p><p>I am considering a mini series of SQL tib-bits, not a thoughtful things, but have something in mind over the month. </p><p><span>Ops! almost missed it, it’s week #52, that is, one year anniversary of </span><a href="https://techstructively.substack.com/p/week-0" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Techstructive Weekly</a><span>. I can’t believe that. I just kept writing and here we are with 50 weeks of constant reflection and hitting the publish button.</span></p><p>I am not going to stop this, instead I fancy myself writing more over the months and years, because some has said it.</p><blockquote><p>Writing is thinking and thinking is writing.</p></blockquote><p>There might be 104th edition of this newsletter with nothing new, maybe it will be completely changed, who knows what the future holds, but one thing is certain, something will change in me because of this. A hope, and not a false one.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/169231456/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>"A year from now you may wish you had started today." </p><p>— Karen Lamb</p></blockquote><p>I don’t regret even a slightest that I started writing this weekly a year back. I learnt to articulate better, knew things I forget in a day or two. Helped me organise my learning and reading resources, be mindful about the media that I consume, helped me get over the blank page fear and most importantly helped me cultivate the reflective mindset rather than what next. Because this period when I write this is important for planing and thinking next what to do.</p><p>So, what is something I wish I would do now?</p><ul><li><p>Log the things and observations about LLMs and different models or even versions.
