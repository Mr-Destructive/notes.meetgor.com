It is Diwali this weekend and next week. So, the preparations, the cleaning of homes, were done past weekend. It actually took my whole Sunday, sweet Sunday, and even half of Saturday. Hh! I read a lot of books, though. I found a great book that fits the vibe I wanted while being in the atmosphere of Diwali.</p><p>At work, I was busy with simple log aggregation and number crunching for all the hard work we have been doing for the past 4-5 months. The fruits and results of that work were satisfying on a personal level, but there are always improvements and gaps people find, and the harsh lessons I have learnt from the little life I have spent. I know how to stay positive and happy, I don’t need someone’s appreciation for that.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Loggers Clog<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§loggers-clog"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/176424817/loggers-clog" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p>I almost gave up trying to get logs from the GCP Log Explorer. The UI is super slow. I have to be careful I don’t keep multiple tabs open, editors open, otherwise it clogs the CPU, and I have to restart the system. I have 8 GB of RAM, who on earth uses  Slack, Google, and VS****, do? They can’t bear just being in the idle state.</p><p>I finally decided, I need to write my own TUI for GCP Log Explorer. I searched but found none. I asked LLMs to find me if any, but no result. I had to sit down and build it. But then, I don’t have a GCP account. I know I can create a free trial, but I want to save it for some other day, when I will probably start my startup. Maybe. So, how do I really test it? Testing with the Work credentials will be like bombarding too much, and I would probably livestream building that. So, what do I do? Use other Log providers and mock GCP Log Explorer? Maybe...</p><p>I’ll have to sit and decide what and how to build that Logger TUI. This weekend its hard to start it, but next weekend probably sounds like it.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/176424817/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“Darkness isn’t real.

Its not about buying new things, its about opening the doors that you are keeping yourself shut, its the time to dust off things and bring in the memories, the joy, the power, the flame, the light back.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p></p><div><hr/></div><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/176424817/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/10/10/notes-on-switching-to-helix-from-vim/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Notes on switching to Helix from Vim</a></p><ul><li><p>I like this approach of adapting to tooling. The author had clearly listed the reason, the main crux of why he chose Helix over Vim in the first place.</p></li><li><p>I like that the language server is built in, just like PyCharm is for Python. VS Code, you have to install plugins or extensions. Vim as well you’ll have to configure LSPs and plugins. Helix is a good middle ground, I think.</p></li><li><p>No tool is perfect, and it obviously has some quirks and things that might not please everyone, you just have to get used to them.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/syntax-highlighting-is-a-waste-of-an-information/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Syntax highlighting is a waste of the information channel</a></p><ul><li><p>This is unique thinking. I like it, I can see how it can help developers understand and read code. But having that specific mode toggled is quite challenging and worth digging into. </p></li><li><p>Tree sitter is quite the thing that we can use here, but toggling different modes in different contexts is quite absurd, I think.</p></li><li><p>How would you know which mode works in the given context? I guess you’ll have to try a few things and get a sense of what you are trying to learn from the code.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.burkert.me/posts/llm_evolution_character_manipulation/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">LLMs are getting better at character-level manipulation</a></p><ul><li><p>Its evident from the test that newer and larger models are better at generalizing Base64 encoding and decoding. So that implies they will get better at character-level manipulation and analysis.</p></li><li><p>Sadly the how many r’s in strawberry problem will be solvable by LLMs</p></li><li><p>Thinking is out of the equation, the crux here is the tokenisation, the better sense of the word you have, the better it understands, but the fine balance between less and more context is critical, and I think it is still being fine tuned to get a sweet spot.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://marcobambini.substack.com/p/the-secret-life-of-a-local-first" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Secret Life of Local First Value</a></p><ul><li><p>This is lovely. So well explained what CRDTs are. It’s like a log of what happened in a  row of a table. Like column-level details of updation/insertion and deletion. It makes sense now.</p></li><li><p>The metadata table is the crux of this structure. What would happen if the database itself crashes? That is unlikely, I think. SQLite cannot crash at least locally. Nice thinking here.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://www.i-programmer.info/news/99-professional/18368-there-are-no-programmers-in-star-trek.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">There are no programmers in Star Trek</a></p><ul><li><p>This makes me sad, if there are no real programmers, how are their services operating?
