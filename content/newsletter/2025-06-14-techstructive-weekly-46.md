I was here last week, complaining about life and here I am today, feeling grateful for whatever happened to me.</p><p>I took decisions last week and by mid-week, I was seeing results, like actual results. And I was just thrilled to experience it, when you decide to change, the universe listens and blesses you with opportunities. I am grateful for the things blessed to me through the week. Even if I fail next week, I have a head start to keep going and break the shackles one day.</p><p>Throughout the week, I dabbled in LLMs. Learning about different providers and models.</p><p><span>I spent 20 minutes playing this game before writing this newsletter. I was reading the Hacker News newsletter, and I saw this </span><a href="https://midword.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">link</a><span> and wow, the game is so cool. A binary search to find a word.

I understood the reason why Kubernetes exists</p></li><li><p>I knew the concept of Docker (it could be because I have used it extensively in the past to create projects as well in my internships to deploy APIs and apps)</p></li><li><p>But the concept of Kubernetes is like a black-box.

This was so relatable to read on a Sunday afternoon.</p></li><li><p>This feels relatable to feel like how can people draw conclusions and biases when the technology is evolving everyday.</p></li><li><p>People are either fully bullish on AI, i.e. by 2026, no developers needed, to some saying AI is still crap. Both of them don’t know what AI is capable yet. It is not that bad, compared to a year ago, it’s really good at generating almost accurate code, but not quite the touch that it can be untouched without a developer glancing and ficing it. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://annievella.com/posts/the-software-engineering-identity-crisis/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Software Engineering Identity Crisis</a></p><ul><li><p>The quote that sums this well is this:</p><blockquote><p><span>Perhaps the most valuable skill in this new landscape isn’t prompt engineering or systems architecture, but </span><strong>adaptability</strong><span> - the willingness to evolve, to learn new skills, and to find your unique place in a rapidly changing field.</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Adoption is a skill that you can hone and be an engineer of the AI revolution</p></li><li><p>The author thinks that there will be engineering in terms of managing and overlooking Agents or AI Systems. Also a good point mentioned is “The scope of engineering is not shrinking, it’s expanding”. I can see this point coming true in some sense as the level of understanding to drive these AI systems is better suitable to programmers and engineers. Since they already deal with the pain of solving problems. AI is no different.</p></li><li><p>The first part that hits me the most is the loss of joy. I talked about it in the previous weeks.

The function calling thing just blew the AI hype and at that time, the LLMs were not ready or trained for it. But in 2025, those LLMs are optimised for it, making it a great ecosystem to work towards.</p></li><li><p>This actually raises questions: Do you really need the craft? The IDE? If the agent can do it for you at the speed of a prompt? Yes, LLMs are not gods, they need assistance, and when they go berserk, its on the developer to hone on his tools and hack it out of the mess.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Gentle Singularity: Sam Altman’s Blog</a></p><ul><li><p>Sam thinks that GPTs are powerful than any human lived on earth, is that really accurate? Maybe, in terms of knowledge, but that’s not truly knowledge. It does have billions of weights that somewhat represent the knowledge, but can it make sense of it? No, not yet. With tools and reasoning, maybe, but not quite without proper instructions.</p></li><li><p>The other stuff is just sci-fi future prediction. I don’t think that is true, but his vision is a bit daunting if that is slightly true.</p></li><li><p>He also mentions how many watts are consumed per GPT call, which is hilariously alarming.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://world.hey.com/jorge/anyone-can-cook-c6346f84" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Anyone can cook: How 37 Signals hired a junior developer</a></p><ul><li><p>Intrinsic motivation is greater than an educational degree; this is true for any professional.
