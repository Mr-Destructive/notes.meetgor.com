I would be writing a yearly review in a couple of weeks and this week might lift my spirits up. I was fresh, given time off from work, not really, but given the time to experiment.</p><p>I read a lot, fiction, technical, even philosophical, and random Hacker News articles. I read 2 books of Harry Potter. I haven’t read Harry Potter, I have watched the first 3 movies, but not books. I enjoyed it, it was subtly different from movies, I missed the quote “What an Idiot” from the movies, it was not in the book, i was disappointed but the atmospheric adventures was amazing read.</p><p>I even played with golang after a while, I streamed after ages. I felt back. I might be making much more comebacks.  Have lot of ideas for projects, I know how to deal with such situations, now, do one thing. Don’t get into a trap of overthinking and porcastinating and delaying for prefection traps. Just start one project or one improvement and lets see where it leads me.</p><h3 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/181440615/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><blockquote><p>“Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain”</p><p>-- Mr. Arthur Weasley, Harry Potter and the Chambers of secret (Chapter 18)</p></blockquote><p>I don’t know how I picked it up. But it hit me right on. LLMs are like Tom Riddle’s diary, aren’t they? I feel so relatable here. Software developers like me are Ginny and they hallucinate us to do certain things in a certain way and we follow it, like in a trance, and it makes the software collapse. What a relatable quote. It makes me think that reading fiction is healing. For nerds like me, I would just read and escape the world.</p><div><hr/></div><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Read<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§read"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/181440615/read" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://rapha.land/craft-software-that-makes-people-feel-something/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Craft Software that make people feel something</a></p><ol><li><p><span>So good. Just do it because there is a curiosity. Inspiration is also cool and need for software to make.</span><br/><span>&gt; When programming becomes repetitive, the odds of you creating something that makes people go “wow” are reduced quite a bit. It isn’t a rule, of course. You need to be inspired to make inspiring software.</span></p></li><li><p><span>This is aspiration, the level of it is high here.</span><br/><span>&gt; This is what I’m talking about: taking time to build something so that once people try it, they remember it for as long as they live.</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://stephenramsay.net/posts/vibe-coding.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">If you’re going to vibe code, why not do it in C or even Assembly</a></p><ol><li><p>Yeah!

Well spoken.</span><br/><span>&gt; They are here because they love research and want to contribute to advancing human knowledge. If you take the human out of the loop, meaning that humans no longer have any role in scientific research, you’re depriving them of the activity they love and a key source of meaning in their lives. And we all want to do something meaningful. Why, I asked, do you want to take the opportunity to contribute to science away from us?</span></p></li><li><p><span>This hits it harder</span><br/><span>&gt; Science automation is coming whether we want it or not, and we’d better get used to it. The train is coming, and we can get on it or stand in its way.</span><br/><span>&gt; I think that is a remarkably cowardly argument.</span><br/><span>&gt; It is up to us as a society to decide how we use the technology we develop. It’s not a train, it’s a truck, and we’d better grab the steering wheel.</span></p></li><li><p><span>There are bangers after bangers</span><br/><span>&gt; Making human intellectual or creative work redundant is something we should avoid when we can, and we should absolutely avoid it if there are no equally meaningful new roles for humans to transition into.</span></p></li><li><p><span>I want to quote each and every paragraph it seems, this is so good, almost like it comes out of my mouth</span><br/><span>&gt; You could further argue that working on cutting humans out of meaningful creative work such as scientific research is incredibly egoistic. You get the intellectual satisfaction of inventing new AI methods, but the next generation don’t get a chance to contribute. Why do you want to rob your children (academic and biological) of the chance to engage in the most meaningful activity in the world?</span></p></li><li><p>So true, I have been here when there was model after model releases in a week, i think in August-September. It was a wild month. I was overwhelmed, I didn’t get a chance to slow down. AI can do a lot of things, can produce a lot of things, and I cannot handle it at that pace. I need time to absorb, it makes productive, true, but it quickly overshoots the danger productive bar. The moment where you are too much productive that you lose track of every context in your head.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/software-never-fails" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Software never Fails</a></p><ol><li><p>It never fails. It does what it was intended to do. If the intended thing and the actual thing was different than that’s a developer problem and not the software’s. It did what was written as its not a magic wand that will do what you thought to do.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><a href="https://enombic.com/read-more-than-write" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">I read more than I write, do you?</a></p><ol><li><p>Yes, this is true for me too. Reading needs to be more or rather at certain point, balanced from writing.</p></li><li><p>You can’t just keep on reading and produce nothing. You will have to reflect on what you have consumed.

There were a lot of things, I took for granted, they got lost and most of the things didn’t stick.

Software is not architect a building but its growing a garden. You don’t have a layout already built, some parts are clear not all. Software is ever changing.

Embrace the way it is, adapt the skills, there’s no other way.</p><p><span>For more news, follow the </span><a href="https://buttondown.com/hacker-newsletter/archive/774/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Hackernewsletter</a><span> (#774th edition), and for software development/coding articles, join </span><a href="http://daily.dev/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">daily.dev</a><span>.</span></p><p>See you next week!</p><p>Happy Coding</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://techstructively.substack.com/p/techstructive-weekly-72/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://techstructively.substack.com/p/techstructive-weekly-72/comments" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://techstructively.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share","text":"Share Techstructive Weekly","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://techstructively.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share Techstructive Weekly</span></a></p><p></p></div></div>
