## Week #72

A good productive week (I am not sure, I am saying that in the last month of 2025). I would be writing a yearly review in a couple of weeks and this week might lift my spirits up. I was fresh, given time off from work, not really, but given the time to experiment.

I read a lot, fiction, technical, even philosophical, and random Hacker News articles. I read 2 books of Harry Potter. I haven’t read Harry Potter, I have watched the first 3 movies, but not books. I enjoyed it, it was subtly different from movies, I missed the quote “What an Idiot” from the movies, it was not in the book, i was disappointed but the atmospheric adventures was amazing read.

I even played with golang after a while, I streamed after ages. I felt back. I might be making much more comebacks. Have lot of ideas for projects, I know how to deal with such situations, now, do one thing. Don’t get into a trap of overthinking and porcastinating and delaying for prefection traps. Just start one project or one improvement and lets see where it leads me.

### Quote of the week

> “Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain”
> 
> -- Mr. Arthur Weasley, Harry Potter and the Chambers of secret (Chapter 18)

I don’t know how I picked it up. But it hit me right on. LLMs are like Tom Riddle’s diary, aren’t they? I feel so relatable here. Software developers like me are Ginny and they hallucinate us to do certain things in a certain way and we follow it, like in a trance, and it makes the software collapse. What a relatable quote. It makes me think that reading fiction is healing. For nerds like me, I would just read and escape the world.
