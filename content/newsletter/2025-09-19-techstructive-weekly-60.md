Until I started to learn SQL, and boy o boy, I feel like I don’t even know a drop in an ocean. Database is a vast field. Such is life, there is a lot to learn, once to learn something, you get a little egoistic. That is where you have to wake up and be grounded and humbled, realise that what you know might be temporary or is already known or created by some other human. Respect it and move forward to gain more and provide your experience and guidance to others, the same way the people have done to make you learn it.</p><p></p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Created<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§created"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/174030139/created" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><p>Wrote more blog posts on SQLite and Relations:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-primary-key-column-constraint" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite: PRIMARY KEY column constraint</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-primary-key-table-constraint" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite: PRIMARY KEY table constraint</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-foreign-key-table-constraint" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite: Foreign KEY table constraint</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-one-to-many-foreign-key" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite: One to Many Relation with Foreign Key</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-self-join-relations" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite: Self Join Relations</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-many-to-many-relations" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite: Many to Many Relations</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.meetgor.com/sqlog/sqlite-one-to-one-relations" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQLite: One to One Relations</a></p></li></ol><p>This makes it the 32 posts in total, have been writing daily for a month, and could see a lot of confidence and new energy surging within me.

Stored makes write heavier but are read efficient. Virtual makes it write easier and read heavier. You have trade-offs, you need to decide based on the computation that impacts how you want the column to be generated.</p></li><li><p>I don’t like the notion of JSON flattening in Postgres. Postgres is not a database that would be ideal for that kind of data. I know there are tons and tons of support for JSON, but tables and JSON, I can’t bare it at once. Those two are just separate entities for me. Maybe they are useful in one-off values, not not much. Switch to NoSQL if you have that lengthy data.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://jenson.org/boring/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Boring is good</a></p><ul><li><p>Yes, this post summarises the current trend in LLMs well. The hype is about people adopting to the value of LLMs, but soon they’ll will realise that they were on the wrong path (one example is they thinking, LLMs could replace developers) and then we will settle on the thing they are good at. I know, throwaway code, temporary code, and simple stuff that you know you need to do, you know how to do, but not worth the time to manually type it in and craft it.</p></li><li><p>I am really excited and positive about the SLMs, the small language models, I want to use it to just be a google search but simple and not ripping out my entire project into a react and python boilerplate mess.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/work-hard-have-fun-go-home/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Work Hard, have fun, go home</a></p><ul><li><p>If you have fun you can work sustainably, else no matter how trendy or shinny the technology you would use, you won’t endure it long enough on the verge of burnout and the feeling of unsatisfied will crumble your efforts.</p></li><li><p>Maintaining balance is key, but flowing with the excitement and energy is also helpful not always but can be done to improve the fun and memorable parts.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://devlogs.xyz/blog/building-a-lexical-analyzer-from-scratch" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Building a lexical analyzer from scratch in C</a></p><ul><li><p>This actually cleared up how to write lexers from scratch. I was wondering if that was bunch of if-else to parse each tokens, but we do have to group the kind of tokens and then write specific conditions on how to parse them. Now that makes a lot of sense.</p></li><li><p>Worth exploring more by writing my own markdown parser, even adding more features and syntax. If your soul screams to write your own flavour of markdown, let the muse take over you. This month or one day, not this weekend though.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2025/bookmarks-static-site/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Creating a static site for all my bookmarks</a></p><ul><li><p>I am very much this kind of person, I want to access my bookmarks and the linkblog too.</p></li><li><p>I am developing it, but can’t make it polished enough to be usable.

LLMs are things that produce logits, which is like a list of probabilities from a vocabulary and for each token the highest probability token should have been chosen, however it is random the temperature determines how random the selection is, 0 means choose the first(highest probable, no creativeness), 1 means choose any random one.
