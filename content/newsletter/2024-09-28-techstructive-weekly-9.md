Need to get one video out this weekend to get into the habit. This October I will be trying to build my own writing routine, it won’t be for technical articles, but I won’t be surprised if I find it helpful to write more technical articles.</p><p>This week, I had times where I said, I can still solve problems, Look LLMs you are still idiot. The next day, it just helped me just a function with some function signature and proper data type of parameters and return value. I am not saying, LLMs are complete idiots, but they don’t have sense what they are talking about, they sound like they have, but no, sorry. I would love to improve my productivity, by that I mean to speed up my process for searching, copy pasting from elsewhere, scrambling all over the internet to understand something. It just is like a little pipeline, I throw at it some things, If it makes sense to me, I accept, else I trash it, back to old ways. </p><p><span>I will be making up for the </span><a href="https://techstructively.substack.com/p/techstructive-weekly-8" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">last week</a><span> slump, I said in the quote </span></p><blockquote><p>“Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow”</p><p>— Mary Anne Radmacher</p></blockquote><p>Here I am proving it, I am excited to get into the weekend, pumped up and ready for a change in habits and routine. Last week I was frustrated, maybe burned out, I practically didn’t do anything last weekend, but I din’t quit, I said will be back next week.</p><p>Actually last week I had my convocation, I remembered it now. The Saturday, the whole day went in that, hanging out with friends, maybe for the last time officially. It feels a bit bitter-sweet that I completed 4 years of the degree college.</p><h2 class="header-anchor-post">Quote of the week<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top" id="§quote-of-the-week"></div><button aria-label="Link" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o" data-href="https://techstructively.substack.com/i/149358464/quote-of-the-week" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-link" fill="none" height="18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></button></div></div></h2><blockquote><p><em><span>""Fall seven times, stand up eight."</span><br/><span>— Japanese Proverb</span></em></p></blockquote><p>The past few weeks were tough for me, not as any bad thing, but just things are bit off for me.
