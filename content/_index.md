# Hello, I'm Meet Gor! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building systems, writing technical notes, and sharing my journey through my weekly newsletters.

This space serves as my digital garden where I curate:
- **Posts**: In-depth articles on Go, Python, SQL, and system design.
- **Links**: Interesting things I've read and watched across the web.
- **Newsletter**: Archives of my weekly reflections and learnings.
- **Thoughts & Quotes**: Random snippets of wisdom and personal reflections.

Feel free to explore and connect with me!
