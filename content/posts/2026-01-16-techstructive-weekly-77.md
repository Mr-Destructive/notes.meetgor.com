Week #77

It was a harsh week. Not the roughest yet tiny exhilarating with new hopes. It happens, to get the best of me, things will come towards me with force. I am welcome to those challenges and hurdles.

I am in awe and inspired to build things, I went off track last week. The previous week I was pumped with two side project in a day, yet slumped then. This week would like to build that momentum back.

### Quote of the week

> "You need to control the mind. Thoughts will tempt, but you decide to act or let it go"

I must practise it heavily. Working remotely is tiring in a different way. Sometimes you just have no one to talk to, no one to understand your mindset. I get caught in overthinking and contemplating and procrastination. I need to divert myself to other things, its not like I don't work. I just cannot resist AI to delegate the work and let me read more articles and watch tutorials and videos. It hard to control the mind, but I think its more important in being aware of it.
