## Week #64

It was a pretty busy week, not from a work perspective but from the chaotic household perspective. It is Diwali this weekend and next week. So, the preparations, the cleaning of homes, were done past weekend. It actually took my whole Sunday, sweet Sunday, and even half of Saturday. Hh! I read a lot of books, though. I found a great book that fits the vibe I wanted while being in the atmosphere of Diwali.

At work, I was busy with simple log aggregation and number crunching for all the hard work we have been doing for the past 4-5 months. The fruits and results of that work were satisfying on a personal level, but there are always improvements and gaps people find, and the harsh lessons I have learnt from the little life I have spent. I know how to stay positive and happy, I don’t need someone’s appreciation for that.

### Loggers Clog

I almost gave up trying to get logs from the GCP Log Explorer. The UI is super slow. I have to be careful I don’t keep multiple tabs open, editors open, otherwise it clogs the CPU, and I have to restart the system. I have 8 GB of RAM, who on earth uses Slack, Google, and VS****, do? They can’t bear just being in the idle state.

I finally decided, I need to write my own TUI for GCP Log Explorer. I searched but found none. I asked LLMs to find me if any, but no result. I had to sit down and build it. But then, I don’t have a GCP account. I know I can create a free trial, but I want to save it for some other day, when I will probably start my startup. Maybe. So, how do I really test it? Testing with the Work credentials will be like bombarding too much, and I would probably livestream building that. So, what do I do? Use other Log providers and mock GCP Log Explorer? Maybe...

I’ll have to sit and decide what and how to build that Logger TUI. This weekend its hard to start it, but next weekend probably sounds like it.

### Quote of the week

> “Darkness isn’t real. It’s just where light hasn’t reached yet. Be that light”

Diwali is a celebration of light, we light our homes and surroundings and the places we consider our home, be it work or the palce where we live. Its not about buying new things, its about opening the doors that you are keeping yourself shut, its the time to dust off things and bring in the memories, the joy, the power, the flame, the light back.
