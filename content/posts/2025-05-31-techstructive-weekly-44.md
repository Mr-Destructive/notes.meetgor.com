## Week #44

It was week of comeback. 1 videos and 2 live streams, back on track. Though lost the steam in the middle of the week. Still fresh and excited to get hands on projects this weekend.

Appwrite Sites? Android Apps for LLMs? AI Agents with some specific goals?

We’ll roll the die and let’s nature take where it wants to. We’ll start though, I realized it at the end of last week. No brainer right, once I start something, it quickly makes me addicted to completing it and the thing in between is curiosity and consistency. Not hamering buzzwords, but truly, I just started to record the video for pydantic AI and I created a few examples, within an hour I had 7 examples created. Some of which I had to discard, but nonetheless, enough material for a video to record.

Hit the record button and started speaking, some 1-2 hours later, was completed with 1 and 20 minutes of raw footage, next day edited it and published. I t turned out to be a 45 minute video, not bad, it only has got around 30 views in 4 days, but nevermind that. I learned a lot and got a good understanding of AI Agents with Pydantic AI.

A good week, looking to the next week for more projects created and feeling more satisfied with my efforts. Because that is what we can do, focus on the efforts, forget about the results.

### Quote of the week

> "You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward."

I created the examples and then recorded the video (i.e. the thing I wanted to show). I knew what I wanted to explain in that video, a general direction, but after creating the examples, I really got the understanding of what I actually meant and what I am creating, that was working backwards and figuring it out on the go.

Simialrly in life, we don’t know the future, we can’t. We know the direction, but not the actual destination. We know what we have done, and by doing what you feel right right now is the way to move ahead, overthinking, perfectioning the thing, will just delay it. Just do it, follow the intuition.
