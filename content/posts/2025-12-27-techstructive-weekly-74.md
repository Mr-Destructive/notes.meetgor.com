## Week #74

It was winding down week, 2025, ending slowly, the biggest irony. The year was full of fast-paced, unprecedented models just dropping here and there. It was hard to keep up with the progress. It was getting overwhelming, no one is used to such a level of information. I was dreading with so much power in our hands. I couldn’t handle it and refrained it and thought it was better to focus on learning new things. I kept using AI tools at work, not by choice, but initially through force but then through necessity.

People made developers go fast, but they realised,

- [Churning code was never the bottleneck](https://ordep.dev/posts/writing-code-was-never-the-bottleneck)
- Solving problems and understanding the business needs was the core goal.

Yet, people thought and here we are with tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and 10 other CLI tools. I learnt the hard way to leverage this tools, to use only when the code was throw away, some scripts, and getting insights from logs. But never on actual bugs and features, it was draining, lacked the joy I get from actually making it.

So, at the end of 2025, I am a decent developer who cannot use AI tools. Yes! give or take, I would love to learn more in 2026.

### Quote of the week

**“I don’t fear a future with AI. I fear a present without thinking.”**

Yes! That is what I believe in this year. I have stopped thinking it seems. If in 2026, we move very fast without thinking, I need to change for the better. The directions we take, everything is a decision, but on what ground, on what thought. If the thought are not 90% yours, you are not thinking enough.

Think, don’t let AI do it.
