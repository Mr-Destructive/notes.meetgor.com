## Week #45

This week was exciting at first, but slowly it went on the extreme bad spectrum for me, leaving a spot for taking a bold decision.

Almost on the verge of a burnout or a big decision. Its been 3 months now, the first sparkle was created and now I think its high time to take the big decision. It’s no longer rash, but it’s a long thought decision.

Anyways, I don’t want to talk about it. Let’s see in the next few weeks where the wind take me.

I explored the AI Agents by creating a local agent in Python from scratch with the Meta AI LLM. It was a fun one, list, read, and edit files tools provided, I also wanted to add shell command execution. Will be doing it next weekend. Also had explored the LLM-plugin for Meta AI LLM wrapper.

### Quote of the week

> "We were born in order to see and listen to the world. It’s a powerful notion, with the potential to subtly reshape our view of everything."
> 
> — Mentioned in [Sweet Bean Paste by Durian Sukegawa](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/26402563)

See and Listen is a very deep thing to do, it just changes everything, it eases the soul, removes the burden and expectations from one’s shoulder. The quote/sentence is simple, yet it hits home for a person feeling lost in life.
