## Week #42

It has been a nasty week, both physically and emotionally. I am sick right now, still somehow finding the right amount of energy to pump this edition out. I have a sore throat and fever. Twitchy eyes in the cold make things worse.

But emotionally, I have been on the battlefield, it seems. The battle has started between my heart and mind. The one that cares about the craft, my soul, and the other about the ego, duties and responsibilities, fame, the thing that I am right now. It’s intense, I am barely able to breathe and think. It’s making me doubt myself, my decisions, my efforts, and my existence.

The war is not about winning, it is about fighting; even if I were to lose, I would be happy I fought. I didn't give up, but the opponent was a bit more powerful. There will be a revenge if I loose of course, but that is the worst case scenario.

Back to tech, I have been working on VLLMs, i.e., using Visual inputs to LLMs to get things out from it. Usually for extraction, summarizing, etc. And it was not that exciting, because I feel awkward working with LLMs these days. Especially to write code, not the process of integrating, I love that, but I am kind of forced to use LLMs in doing anything at work. Kind of feels like lavish luxury to some people, but for me, it’s a curse, a way to dig your own grave. People don't realize that LLMs are making humans dumb; they are making you think less, and do tab-tab auto-complete. Not saying it’s bad, but using it all the time makes me feel empty inside.

Ah! What a time to be a junior developer. What a worse way to start your career. A bump straight away. No time to think, no time to reflect.

I think this can't be a worse time to be a software developer, at least for the one who care about the art and craft of building software. They can still find joy, but can't hold the responsibilities.

### Quote of the week

> “The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.”  
> — Carl Jung

Yes, this is tough. I might speak a bit repetitively about these things, but this is important to get it out. AI is no longer a small hype like the Web-3 boom of 2022, the COVID pandemic lasting 2 years, it is more than that now. Chat GPT was launched in December of 2022, almost 2 years after its arrival, it has taken humans by storm.

Being able to replace your craft and art that your soul craves and loves with a machine is jarring and draining. As if there is no purpose left for humans. Yes, the quote is rightly placed for this time, at least for me. I don’t know how a developer cannot even feel a little scared after all of this. Hopefully, we will have some positive directions soon.
