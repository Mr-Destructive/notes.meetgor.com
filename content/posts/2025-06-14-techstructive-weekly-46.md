## Week #46

Life takes turns pretty quickly. I was here last week, complaining about life and here I am today, feeling grateful for whatever happened to me.

I took decisions last week and by mid-week, I was seeing results, like actual results. And I was just thrilled to experience it, when you decide to change, the universe listens and blesses you with opportunities. I am grateful for the things blessed to me through the week. Even if I fail next week, I have a head start to keep going and break the shackles one day.

Throughout the week, I dabbled in LLMs. Learning about different providers and models.

I spent 20 minutes playing this game before writing this newsletter. I was reading the Hacker News newsletter, and I saw this [link](https://midword.com/) and wow, the game is so cool. A binary search to find a word. A wordle but not quite that.

### Quote of the week

> **“Practice doesn’t make perfect. Practice reduces the imperfection.”**

I have been in the craft of programming for over 5 years, and now I know that it’s about figuring things out. I was naive and all over the place when I started, but slowly I learnt from mistakes and started to feel the patterns in solving problems. I am not perfect, never will be, but will have less muddier and novice like traits in me.

That’s what it means to live a developer’s life, really, adopting and adopting till your hunger and curiosity to know things is satisfied, it will be on you to keep it on till your last breathe.
