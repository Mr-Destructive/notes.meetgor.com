This is cool, maybe a little too much time aware, maybe doing it too much is bad, but still, a good way to break the mental procrastination cycle
I think we can get a idea or get aware of the amount of time we wasted or done something good, and act on it accordingly. A nice trick for the brain

9:45: Wrap up the standup
9:54: Log clearing
10:15: Call with manager about the task
10:33: Felt bad
