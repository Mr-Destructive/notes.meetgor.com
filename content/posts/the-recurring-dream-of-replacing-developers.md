- what a flashback, everything makes sense.
- Programming is not mechanical
- yet people tried hard to make solve for it as it was mechanical
- COBOL made syntax readable. CASE tools eliminated typing. Visual tools eliminated syntax. AI can now generate entire functions from descriptions
- Each advancement addressed a real friction point. Yet the fundamental challenge persists because it’s not mechanical. It’s intellectual. Software development is thinking made tangible
- Just sheer facts those two. We need to find a way around using AI not away from it.
