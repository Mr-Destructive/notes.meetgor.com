A well written and concise guide on template parsing with golang.
I used to get confused with parsing and rendering the template, this makes it really clear by showing bit-sized examples.

- Using custom functions is a high-value tip, I can see myself using those for string-related functions like title case, stringify, date parsing, etc.
- Another great example is the templates, we can create partials for reusability.

Must read for golang beginners.
