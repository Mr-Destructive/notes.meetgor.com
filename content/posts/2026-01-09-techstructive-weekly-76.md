Week #76

It was a good start to the year, finally doing something that I had struggled to do for the past year or so. AI Assisted Programming. Yeah! That was something I finally somewhat understand, and can do it without feeling a slightest of grudge or emotional drama. It took a while to realize it, but here we are. 2026!

I don't know how I feel right now. Its quite a good times to be in tech.

This is true. I think we should treat people with kindness irrespective of their position. Position is no match for one's love and care for us. They might be doing with their own purpose and needs but they still show it.
