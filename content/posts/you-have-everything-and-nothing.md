Man, that was a heck of an article to read. I continued reading it because I found it relatable to Minecraft.
- You open a world, you have an empty inventory
- Still you believe you can win the game
- Without anything, "Kya lekar aya jagath me, kya lekar jayega" vibes

True, read it, it will change your perspective on reasoning for failure in a good way.
