This is interesting and it comes at the right time

> facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever

> It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.

> What is the social solution, then? Innovation can't be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy.

All points and counterpoints are well addressed here. Innovation can't be taken back, that just hits hard. Harsh reality even. AI is in the wild, you can't avoid it, you'll have to capture and understand them, just like pokemons. Its hard at first, but never say never. I learnt the hard way, kept giving AI things, tried different things, modes and models, and found the mindset shift. I found what I cared the most, but also a part of me felt taken away.
