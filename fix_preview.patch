The issue is that `marked` is a variable/function reference in JavaScript that's called as marked(content).
In modern versions of marked, it's now a named export that requires initialization.

The CDN script loads marked but we need to:
1. Initialize marked properly
2. Ensure the function is available when the editor JavaScript runs
